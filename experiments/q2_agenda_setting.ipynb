The government of the time responded by launching the largest humanitarian mission in the Mediterranean, Mare Nostrum. My thoughts today go not only to the victims, but also to those who are committed, every day, to saving human lives, to the women and men of the Italian Coast Guard, to the mayors involved in reception and integration, to the NGOs, unfortunately increasingly criminalized for their humanitarian activity. I would like this date to be remembered as Remembrance Day to honor all the men, women and children who lost their lives because they were forced to leave their country.\n",

      "\tMadam President, on 7 July 2019, almost exactly three years ago, the Prime Minister won the Greek elections in a landslide victory. The Greek people sent a strong message of support and trust to you, Prime Minister, and to Nea Demokratia to steer the future of Greece and turn a page on the failed policies of Alexis Tsipras and Syriza. When you came into office, Greece was in bad shape, I think that was obvious. After painful years of poor leadership by Tsipras, you put Greece back on track – and thank you for this remarkable and excellent work. Thanks to you and thanks to your government, Greece is back in Europe and that is good news. It is important for Europe to have Greece back. First of all, everybody, I think, should and must underline that Greece is in a way not a normal country because democracy was born in Greece. Our western civilization was born in Greece. Europe was born in Greece, not to mention the princess taken away by Zeus to beautiful Crete, the princess who gave her name to our old joint project, Europa. There is no Europe without Greece. Greece is back on economic issues. Last year, even in crisis times, the Greek economy grew by more than 8%. When it comes to growth, Greece is among Europe’s top five countries. You managed to reduce unemployment in Greece. In Greece, in the quarter from summer 2019 to February 2022, more than any other country, you did it and the people feel the success in their daily life. Thanks to your efforts and to the determination of the government, Greece is finally also on the way to exiting the surveillance programme. On another aspect, Greece is back and that is about the security issues. Since you took over, Greece seriously cares about security again. Greece, due to its geographic position, is key when it comes to European security. Europe is not to be criticised but to thank Greece for protecting and defending our common external borders. And I want to be very clear on this, and I see that each and every single event on the border between Turkey and Greece is in this European Parliament an issue, and it’s okay that we discuss the issues. But on the other hand we saw in Spain, on the Spanish-Moroccan border, an event where more than 20 people died. And I have to tell you that the Socialists and the Greens didn’t initiate a debate about the events in Spain, but they initiate always a debate when it is about Greece. So we should care about the migrants and not about party political issues when it is about migrants. I have to be clear on this, that the PPE is strongly on the side of our Greek authorities. Erdoğan is misusing migrants as a political weapon like Lukashenko did. For us that’s clear. Our border guards, who are doing everyday the job of protecting people and the border, we trust them, we are respecting their work every day in the interests of all of us. What we have to do is to strengthen Frontex and what we have to do is also to clarify the rules for pushbacks, and I want to thank Margaritis Schinas for his work in this clarification process. Greece is back also on geopolitical issues. Tsipras, I have to say, mainly cared about Maduro. You care about the European interests in the Mediterranean, and that is good. Not only in the last years do we witness an increasingly destabilising role played by Turkey, dangerously raising the tensions in the region. What Turkey is doing is unacceptable. It is not a problem between Greece and Turkey, but a problem between Europe and Turkey. Greece’s interests are European interests in this border conflict. And we all have to ask ourselves, and probably, Mr Prime Minister, you can reflect a little bit in your final statement, how do we best deal with Erdoğan’s Turkey, a Turkey that is becoming more and more provocative and aggressive? And Greece is back on foreign and defence issues. Putin and Erdoğan tell us one lesson – Europe must grow up when it comes to foreign and security policy. It is great news that Finland and Sweden have finally joined NATO. And as PPE, our parties in Finland and Sweden always fought for becoming NATO members. The Socialists finally also supported this approach. The PPE is fully supporting NATO, but we also think that Europe has to grow up. We must abolish the unanimous vote principle in the Council side when it comes to foreign affairs, and within NATO we have to build a true common European defence with concrete projects like a cyber-brigade or a European missile defence system. Europeans have to be capable of defending themselves if it is needed. And if you will allow me, I want to finalise with a more general consideration, because you delivered, Mr Prime Minister, a great speech in the US Congress and in the Senate a few weeks ago. It was a big honour for you to be there as one of the European leaders. And when we look to the US and we also look to our European democracies, we have to see that these democracies are under stress. We are facing populism and extremism, and probably most fundamental question is, can we agree still in our societies about what is true, what is the reality? Because we have fake news discussions – you mentioned this – we have propaganda from China, from Russia, which tried to change what is true, the reality which we are based on. And without the common understanding in our societies about what is true, what is the reality, you cannot build up a lively democratic discussion between Greens, Socialists, the PPE and so on and so forth, and people cannot decide. That’s why the idea to strengthen this common base is so important. The fight against propaganda, too often this is unanswered. We have to strengthen good and serious journalism, and we have to make clear that the tech giants have a responsibility. We will vote this week on the DMA and the DSA, which would give and will give an answer on these challenges. So thank you, dear Kyriakos, thanks to you Greece is back in Europe. The Greek people can be proud about these achievements.\n",
      "[ ] 4: Νίκος Ανδρουλάκης (PSE/S&D - social_democratic) [0% migration]\n",
      "\tMadam President, over the last decade, Europe has been confronted with successive crises which have exacerbated inequalities to an extreme degree. The inability to reach understanding, achieve consensus, and provide comprehensive answers to these challenges has made the era of convergence seem like a distant past. The more opportunities for a better life dwindle for millions of European citizens, and the more they feel excluded from a society of equal opportunities, the more threats to liberal democracy will increase. The stagnation imposed on the project of political integration by Europe's conservative forces created an opening for those who reject the European vision to exploit it to their advantage. This is the duo responsible for us remaining, Mr. Prime Minister, a slow-moving ship, as you said a few weeks ago. Some speak in the name of Europe, without doing anything – and I am referring to the conservative forces – while others constantly attack it with Manichaean arguments at every opportunity. Elitism and populism are equally destructive to the European vision. The world, however, is changing, and we must rise to the occasion. We have a duty to do more, and to do it now. We must defend, through a progressive political plan, social justice, solidarity, human rights, and environmental protection. We must make citizens feel safe again against the geopolitical, climatic, and economic challenges of our time. Positive steps, such as the Recovery and Resilience Facility, must acquire permanent characteristics, especially for the Greek people who experienced harsh economic policies. It should be utilized as a tool for social cohesion and strengthening the resilience of our society and economy. I would like to make an aside. It is good to remember the humiliating referendum of 2015, but let us be fair. And remember very well the humiliating era of 2009 when you led the country to a 15.6% external deficit and to bankruptcy, as certified by the resolution of the European Parliament, because these choices by the conservative faction were what opened Pandora's Box in Greece. We must, therefore, talk about young people and create new opportunities to reduce emigration and to strengthen the purchasing power of Greeks, which is the second lowest in Europe. According to Eurostat data, Greek citizens are proportionally burdened much more than other Europeans. There is no provision in the Recovery Fund for the construction of social housing for rent at low cost, as other European countries with similar problems have done. In the healthcare sector, the fact that Greeks rank third in Europe for private expenditure is indicative of the real needs that exist, and the National Health System and primary care must be further strengthened. To address the climate crisis, the Recovery Fund could be the primary lever for the widespread adoption of renewable energy sources through household photovoltaics and energy communities. We have the strange peculiarity that while throughout the European Union the goal is the complete decarbonization of the economy, you are limiting yourselves only to de-lignitisation, as demonstrated in the recent climate law you voted for, making the country vulnerable to expensive and imported natural gas. The European Commission offers the possibility to revise national plans so that investments can now be included in them, such as the upgrade of the country's electricity grid through storage and all the necessary measures we need to strengthen energy autonomy and a just transition. However, I also want to refer to the need for geopolitical security. Putin's illegal and destructive invasion of Ukraine is a tragic event for the Ukrainian people and a very costly lesson for the European elites on how they must deal with authoritarian revisionist leaders. Appeasement, as proven, yields no results. Strong deterrent measures are needed. There is no other path for a strong and self-reliant Europe that will not be a follower of United States foreign policy. That is why I call on you to take a stand. The Greek people, through ten years of continuous crises, have lost almost 25% of their GDP and are forced to pay billions to safeguard the sovereignty of our homeland through armaments programs, while at the same time European states continue to arm those who threaten our sovereign rights. Therefore, a decision must be made here for an arms embargo on Turkey and on anyone who does not respect international law. And I am very pleased that Mr. Weber, in a recent interview, said he supports this. You support it now. However, when the amendment came from the socialists, you personally voted against it. Furthermore, it is inconceivable for European heads of state to adopt Erdoğan's narrative on terrorism, when in Turkey anyone who disagrees with his authoritarian practices, such as Kavala and Demirtaş, is automatically branded a terrorist and an enemy of the nation. Dear colleagues, dealing with leaders who flagrantly violate international law is not a matter for one or two countries, but for all of us. It is our duty for all citizens of the European Union to feel equally safe, wherever they live, from Sweden and Finland to Greece and Cyprus. Therefore, we need to proceed with the necessary institutional changes so that there can finally be a common foreign, defence, and security policy. At a critical moment in history, where nightmarish scenarios reveal our limitations and the past mistakes of all, we have a duty to breathe new life into the European vision, making it once again captivating and hopeful for all European peoples.\n",
      "[ ] 5: Malik Azmani (ELDR/ALDE/Renew - liberal) [13% migration]\n",
      "\tMadam President, Prime Minister, honourable Members, we face a series of alarming challenges that deserve the attention of the solidarity of all of us. The unjust and uncalled for war of aggression raged by Russia in Ukraine is triggering new crises – an energy crisis, food shortages – and these two combined will lead to an economic and perhaps migration crisis. This continent needs to get ready for all of this, doing so while helping the Ukrainians fight their good fight. It’s quite simple: Mr Putin must fail. Therefore, we must stand by the Ukrainian people with determination, and sanctions alone are not enough to ensure Putin’s failure. Ukraine needs our heavy weapons and here all of us have a duty to back our words with actions. There is one man responsible for the food crisis – that’s Vladimir Putin. Food shortages risk many vulnerable adults and children. And they are also a risk of a migration crisis for Europe. And I’m quite certain that a new migration crisis would seem very attractive to Mr Putin, but we cannot let him succeed. We need to finalise a new European migration and asylum pact. We need a strict and fair system for the whole Union to work but we need the whole Union to take its responsibility, and we need to do it now. We have waited for too long and the next migration crisis might be on our doorstep already. The Council needs to move and this House needs to engage in pragmatic negotiating with them to reach a deal before the end of this year. I’m worried when I read some of the reports of violent deportations. Yes, we must uphold EU law and yes, we must protect EU borders, and yes, we must ensure Turkey abides by its obligations to us. But we say no to illegal pushbacks of any kind – in Spain, in Greece or anywhere else. Mr Prime Minister, I hope you can agree with us in Renew Europe that the Europe of today needs to be bold so we can address the cost of living crisis facing Europeans. Like the common solutions we found for the pandemic, innovative thinking is needed to address our energy challenges. We need to boost our economic credentials by signing the free trade deals that are frozen. The deal with New Zealand last week shows us the way. Protectionism is no antidote to inflation. By investing in the modernisation of our economies, by embracing competition, by improving our entrepreneurial and investment climate, we can continue to sail the ship of prosperity. Let us be bold and fight back against global economic headwinds. And then, finally, we see that in many countries, even within the European Union, the values and principles that breathe life into our democracies are under attack. And I will be frank, Prime Minister, as always. We are worried about the decline in press freedom and media pluralism in Greece. The warning lights are flashing. Greece now has the worst performance in the EU27 as far as media freedom is concerned. Mr Prime Minister, I hope you agree with me that media freedom is central to our European way of life. Renew Europe has added a distinguished Greek MEP, Mr Georgios Kyrtsos, to its ranks. He is sitting over there on the first row. Our family expects the voice of its representative to be heard, according to European media rules and standards. We do not want to see another EU government leader slandering the free press because, as you know, it was Socrates who said, ‘When the debate is over, slander becomes the tool of the loser’ and we are aware that some in your political family have set a bad example, but please, Prime Minister, don’t follow in their destructive footsteps. Stop it, Prime Minister, and stop silencing Mr Kyrtsos and stop it now. Hold the pride of the Greek tradition of public debate alive and you will continue to find Renew at your side, facing the crisis ahead together in unity.\n",
      "[x] 6: Tineke Strik (Greens/EFA - green) [37% migration]\n",
      "\tMadam President, I thank you and the Commissioners. Dear Prime Minister, welcome in our House and I also welcome the Minister of European Affairs. During the eurozone crisis, we have painfully witnessed in Greece how citizens suffer if the EU fails to act in unity and solidarity, and citizens should never any more pay the price of a functioning monetary and economic union. Greece should be able to count on the Union to fully reap the benefits of the green transition. But we also count on Greece to defend the fundaments of the Union: a Europe based on democracy, rule of law, media freedom and non-discrimination. A Europe that respects fundamental rights, including human dignity and the right to apply for asylum. And I wonder is this Europe as well, Prime Minister, if asylum seekers try to enter this Europe through your country, their rights are brutally trampled? They are pushed into the Turkish waters and land. Migrants are even forced to push back other migrants and the border guards – masked men putting lives at risk – enjoy impunity. But those who save lives are convicted. And therefore, I ask you, Mr Mitsotakis, is this Europe? You’re closing down the most humane camps and have forced asylum seekers to live in remote and closed hotspots. You lose thousands of asylum seekers from Syria and Afghanistan in a legal limbo, using the fiction that they could return to Turkey, which they can’t. And the lucky refugees that do get a status have to survive on the streets. Yet, those helping refugees are restricted and criminalised; those who speak up, including media, are silenced. But, Prime Minister, covering up evidence doesn’t help, because the reality is recorded and reported time and time again by all relevant bodies of the UN, Council of Europe, by ombudsmen, NGOs and investigative journalists. And European judges refuse to accept this reality as it violates EU asylum law. That, Mr Mitsotakis, is Europe. And let me be clear: other Member States have put Greece in an unfair position. They breached the principle of solidarity by refusing a common responsibility for asylum seekers. We could be allies in combating these selfish policies and to have geopolitical answers to geopolitical conflicts. But sealing off the borders, deterring and pushing back refugees is not the European answer. And, instead of trying to demonstrate a shield for Europe, I urge you to solve the many problems in your society. People are suffering from it: the 36.8% of young people unemployed; the high level of poverty; the increasing use of fossil fuel riding this global crisis, instead of investments in renewable energy. Use the EU funds to create innovative green and social jobs to transform your country into an inclusive, modern and sustainable state. Prime Minister, we count on Greece to honour the fundamental rights on which true European solidarity can be built, both for the Greek citizens and for the refugees. Because there is no Europe left to protect or to defend if its core values are undermined.\n",
      "[ ] 7: Gunnar Beck (ENF/ID - (extreme)_right) [14% migration]\n",
      "\tMadam President, I wish to welcome Prime Minister Mitsotakis to the European Parliament. I would like to congratulate you, Mr Mitsotakis, more than once. First, on paying off your debt to the IMF two years ahead of schedule. However, the euro is quite another matter. It has not served Greece well. Greek inflation stands at 12%. Rents in Athens are up about 17% and petrol prices are approaching EUR 3 per litre. Almost 30% of Greeks are at risk of poverty or social exclusion. One million Greeks work in the tourist sector, but the rental costs of sunbeds in exclusive resorts in Mykonos now equal the monthly minimum wage in Greece. Price rises of up to 110% for Greek hotel rooms far exceed those in other holiday destinations. Lay—offs in the Greek tourist sector therefore seem inevitable. Second, I would like to thank you for your efforts in protecting Europe against the ongoing migrant invasion. Last week you decided to triple the length of the border fence with Turkey and you prevented smugglers from offloading over 1 000 illegal migrants on Greek islands. Third, I applaud your resolve in resisting aggressive posturing from Ankara. Greece’s territorial integrity should be sacrosanct to the EU, more self—evidently so than that of neighbouring non—EU countries. On the other hand, Prime Minister, I firmly disagree with you on the expansion of the European Empire. With the highest inflation rate since the 1970s, this is not the time to waste energy and money on making the Western Balkans ‘fit for 55’. Rather, we should focus on the Greek pension of EUR 384 per month and the 14 million Germans who live near or below the poverty line. Further, your government recently decided to follow Germany in ordering F—35 American fighter jets. Instead, you could have favoured European options to protect European, not American, workers and jobs. Finally, at a recent press conference on demographic change, you seemed to adopt the logic of replacement migration, commending the integration of populations from Asia and Africa as a viable alternative, or as a viable solution to low fertility rates, instead of favouring imaginative family policies, Hungarian style. The truth is that European governments have failed us for 40 years. Even Europe’s richest countries were never rich enough to allow most families to raise two or three children in modest comfort. They are now importing millions of migrants which will rarely work and usually live on welfare. Sadly, our EU leaders are destroying our welfare state through the back door – and European culture and civilisation with it. Prime Minister, I implore you to resist von der Leyen’s ‘great replacement’. Greece was under Ottoman rule for centuries. You have no reason to adopt Germany’s guilt complex.\n",
      "[ ] 8: Εμμανουήλ Φράγκος (ECR - (extreme)_right) [0% migration]\n",
      "\tMadam President, Prime Minister, thank you very much for your presence. For my part, as a young Greek who has been given the opportunity to speak, I would like to address the specific problem of brain drain, a phenomenon of young scientists leaving abroad to find work and a better future, with, of course, undeniably severe consequences for our homeland. Having recently completed my studies at the Aristotle University of Thessaloniki, I found that leaving abroad is an attractive option for 8 out of 10 of my colleagues. For example, during the eight-year period from 2008 to 2016, it is estimated that approximately half a million young Greek students and graduates left, at a cost of about 15 billion euros, as reported by the National Higher Education Authority.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\tBut what is this due to? Firstly, unemployment. According to Eurostat's monthly survey, Greece ranks first in youth unemployment with a rate exceeding 30%. We are among the last OECD countries in terms of employment of young graduates aged 25-34, lagging the average by fourteen percentage points. Secondly, low wages make it difficult to make a living. Unfortunately, young Greeks often, in order to remain in our country, are forced to do something completely different from what they studied. Of course, education is not free. The cost to the Greek state is estimated at 33,000 euros per graduate, yet their skills are ultimately put to use by another country. We can understand that Greece only suffers losses from this situation. Our young people are thus forced to leave Greece to find a well-paid job that aligns with their knowledge and what they studied.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\tUniversities, therefore, have not been sufficiently connected in Greece and within the European Union with the labour market. There isn't what we call an ecosystem that encourages young people to start businesses and innovate, and, crucially, to use their knowledge. As we know, however, work can truly make our young people independent so that they want to remain in Greece — not as clients, but as citizens — and, of course, to be able to start families, so that we can address the enormous demographic problem. So, in addition to the underutilization of our outstanding scientists, we must also consider a subsequent problem. This is none other than the demographic issue. I remind you that, nowadays, for every two adult Greeks, there are approximately 1.2 children, whereas we need more than 2 to sustain ourselves as a nation. Our nation, however, is fading, and the Greek family is disappearing. Our young people, brilliant minds, excellent scientists, and essential for our country, must return. We often see young Greeks in the news innovating, starting businesses, and excelling in foreign countries, but we wonder why this is not happening in Greece.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\tIn your pre-election speeches, you spoke extensively about addressing brain drain. Post-election, you attributed the root of the problem to universities, and in reality, very little has been done. I would therefore like to ask you two fundamental questions on this particular issue: first, whether Greece can bring back all those Greeks who left during the last decade of the crisis, and second, how you plan to reverse this phenomenon.\n",
      "[ ] 9: Δημήτριος Παπαδημούλης (NGL/The Left - left) [6% migration]\n",
      "\tMadam President, Mr. Mitsotakis, welcome to the European Parliament, but I want to tell you from the outset that your government's failure cannot be hidden by attacks and slanders from the very first seconds of your speech against the previous Greek government. Mr. Weber and Mr. Mitsotakis —because you too, Mr. Weber, began with attacks and personal slanders against the former Greek Prime Minister, Alexis Tsipras—, I want to tell you that such obsessions indicate that you may even see Tsipras in your sleep! In a democracy, citizens decide. Yesterday Tsipras was Prime Minister, today it is Mitsotakis, tomorrow, if the Greek people wish it, it could be Tsipras again. We must respect the truth; and the truth says that the New Democracy party bears enormous responsibility for the country's bankruptcy, because it left it in 2009 with a deficit of 15.4% and huge public debt, a clientelist state, corruption, oligarchs, and cronyism. It brought the country into the memoranda, and the Samaras-Venizelos government —in which Mr. Mitsotakis was a leading minister—, blew up the bank: 27% unemployment, huge social inequalities, huge regression. And, instead of the convergence that was the expectation of Greeks when we joined the European Union, 40 years ago, based on what Konstantinos Karamanlis and Andreas Papandreou promised, we have divergence. And you should have talked to us about these things, Mr. Mitsotakis. Greece has the highest inflation in all of Europe: 12% —40% above the Eurozone average—, the second most expensive petrol price in the European Union. According to Eurostat, in terms of citizens' purchasing power, it is 26th out of 27. And you bear a large share of responsibility for this, because apart from imported inflation, we have a party of profiteering and speculation. Greece remains first in public debt and has plummeted, during your years in government: 27th out of 27 in press freedom and 43 positions down in the World Index in 3 years, to position 108. Do you insist, Mr. Mitsotakis, that Reporters Without Borders is an unreliable non-governmental organization? Because I want to give you some news: we, in the European Parliament, consider it very reliable, it is our institutional partner, as it is for the Commission and the Council of Europe and the UN, and in a few hours, together with Ms. Metsola, the President of the European Parliament, we will meet with Reporters Without Borders, whom you slander, to strengthen our cooperation. Tell us, then, why Greece remains first out of 27 in youth unemployment and 27th out of 27 in gender equality? Why in the three years of your government do we have the highest number of pandemic deaths per million inhabitants in all of Western Europe? And one more thing: everything that Mr. Azmani on behalf of the Renew Europe Group and Ms. Strik on behalf of the Greens Group told you, about the need to control illegal pushbacks, is also stated by the European Parliament with the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs, it is also stated by Commissioner Johansson, and they must be controlled because these things are not good for our country —as is the regression of the rule of law. And because I learn that Ms. Vestager asked you for modernization and reforms for the faster administration of justice in Greece —as the slow administration of justice is also an obstacle to investments and the utilization of funds from the Recovery Fund—, I would like, Mr. Mitsotakis, one more thing from you in your second speech: in January in Parliament, you characterized leading Greek journalists and researchers as \"underworld\" and \"gang.\" The Supreme Greek Judicial Council —judges chosen by the leadership of justice, whom you appointed—, unanimously and solemnly acquitted these journalists of all charges. Do you intend to apologize, even once, for the severe characterizations \"underworld\" and \"gang\"? And one last thing about the Recovery Fund: Portugal will use Recovery Fund money to build tens of thousands of beds and apartments for young couples, students, and university students. How will you build them with the money from the Recovery Fund?\n",

During the financial crisis and for a long time thereafter, Greece was considered the EU's problem child. In this regard, Greece has been able to catch up significantly and is now considered one of the fastest-growing economies in Europe. Key topics were, above all, how European integration in the areas of energy supply and security can be further improved. Greece is a strategically important country and protects European external borders. For this, it needs support from the EU. Mitsotakis emphasised regarding Russia's war of aggression against Ukraine that in this war there is only one side on which one can stand – on the side of Ukraine, which is fighting for its freedom and democracy.

      "\tMr President, I thank Vice-President Schinas for his very comprehensive presentation. The European Union is going through a very serious situation. In the last two years, Russia's unjustified war against Ukraine has concentrated our efforts, but it cannot make us forget the Southern Neighbourhood. The serious risk of escalation in the Middle East, the difficulties faced by the countries of the Southern Neighbourhood, or the situation in the Sahel are profound challenges that the European Union cannot ignore. We must act. The agreements with Egypt, or the recent ones with Tunisia and Mauritania, are therefore heading in the right direction. Egypt is a very important neighbour, with significant geostrategic weight. The joint declaration of 17 March, promoted by President Von der Leyen, elevates our partnership with Egypt to a strategic level. This will facilitate political dialogue at the highest level, contribute to strengthening the country's stability, and improve its capacity to face current economic and security threats. Egypt is indeed experiencing a very difficult economic situation, marked by high public debt, elevated inflation, and a severe shortage of foreign currency. I hope that this partnership will contribute to stabilising the country's economy and promoting the necessary structural reforms. This partnership covers other equally important topics — as Vice-President Schinas told us — such as investments in energy, cooperation in the field of migration, or student exchanges — Erasmus+ —, among others. The promotion of democracy, human rights, and fundamental freedoms is also present in the partnership with Egypt. Ladies and gentlemen, Egypt has a great capacity for dialogue with Israel and Palestine. In the current difficult circumstances in the region, Egypt must continue working to achieve a ceasefire and the release of hostages, and to continue facilitating the delivery of humanitarian aid to Gaza. The European Union cannot aspire to be a global actor if, in its own neighbourhood, it is unable to actively defend its interests and values and act in a cohesive and effective manner. We must contribute decisively to the stability and prosperity of our neighbourhood, which is currently going through a very difficult period.\n",

We were surprised. In March this year, the process is repeated, now with Egypt, for 7.4 million euros. Loans, investments, and aid for migration-related programmes. All of this without this Parliament exercising its role of democratic scrutiny. The way the European Commission bypassed this Parliament in concluding these agreements is unacceptable. It is inexplicable – and remains unexplained – how agreements of this nature, which must have involved lengthy preparation, do not pass through Parliament? We want to know what conditionalities – beyond the general conditionalities – the Commission established with these agreements with Tunisia and now with Egypt. Was there urgency? We cannot validate these agreements under the argument of urgency, because that is not true. Today we have a new Pact on Asylum and Migration. The European Parliament demonstrated throughout the 9th legislative term that it can act quickly. We did so, for example, in the European response to COVID-19. The European Parliament is the budgetary authority. It does not relinquish its powers, and we cannot think that it is through urgent disbursements that we will become relevant in the Southern Neighbourhood. This is a very limited and very unstrategic view of the problem.\n",

And it is right that we conclude comprehensive agreements with such strategic partners, covering all policy areas. However, I find it particularly important to emphasise that it is stipulated that financial support for Egypt is tied to the fulfilment of conditions. The conditions mentioned therein are concrete steps towards effective democratic mechanisms. And it is absolutely right that such conditions exist, honourable colleagues. Unfortunately, in my view, it is not concrete enough as it is written here. One thing is clear: Today, there is virtually no opportunity for civil society in Egypt to express itself openly and critically about the current government. In my view, structural reforms for more human rights and a functioning rule of law are urgently needed in Egypt. And regarding migration management, it must also be absolutely clear, in my view, that human rights are non-negotiable, honourable colleagues. The documented abuses that also occur in Egypt, for example, involving refugees from Sudan, must be investigated and must not form the basis for cooperation between the European Union and Egypt.\n",

The anomaly is that after two resolutions voted here condemning the actions of the Sisi government, you decided to sign contracts for 7.5 billion. As the standing rapporteur for Egypt in this institution, I have consistently called for strong and precise conditionalities regarding this regime. Through your sleight of hand, Ms von der Leyen ended up receiving a very clear recommendation from the Council. The Council asks you to implement concrete conditionalities in your report to the Sisi regime. If you have no ideas, I will give you some: lift censorship on independent media, release the 60,000 prisoners, stop the pressure on civil society and the opposition, protect sexual equality and the rights of minorities, migrants, and refugees. Today, Mr Commissioner, 18 women were arrested by the Sisi regime because they were demonstrating in front of the United Nations office with a simple petition on the situation in Gaza and Sudan. Where are human rights in this country? Where are the commitments of this regime? After having disregarded Parliament, will Ms von der Leyen also disregard the Council and its recommendations? Stop your hidden agenda. Stop this morbid project which aims to transform the European Union into a World Bank for dictatorships and authoritarian regimes.

      "\tMr President, Egypt is an essential partner for France and the European Union in Africa. Cairo is currently facing immense challenges. Egypt must strive for food, energy, economic, and financial sovereignty, amidst a particularly degraded neighbourhood. The European Union therefore has everything to gain by standing alongside it. While everyone acknowledges Cairo's decisive role in the pursuit of peace in the Holy Land, Egypt's actions are also beneficial elsewhere, both for its region and for the European Union. In Sudan, Egypt plays an essential humanitarian and diplomatic role, while also hosting refugees from the civil war tearing the country apart. At its Libyan border, Egypt ensures the fight against terrorism, just as it has done for years in the Sinai. While the dark hours of the country's domination by Mohammed Morsi's Muslim Brotherhood have barely faded, Cairo has regained its pivotal role in international negotiations. I can therefore only welcome Egypt's participation in the Horizon Europe programme. I hope this progress heralds further advancements, particularly regarding a partnership for migration prevention. This is also an excellent signal for European businesses, which benefit from the new prospects opening up in this territory. France is already at the forefront of projects related to the Cairo Metro, but would benefit from investing more in developing Egyptian markets, such as the construction of the New Cairo city. In Egypt, due to strong demographic pressure, immense construction projects are flourishing, in which our businesses must be supported. As competition rages with Chinese, American, and Arab groups, it is important that European companies play a leading role in the country. At the heart of the emergence of a multipolar world, the European Union must support the intensification of its relations with its historical partners. While this parliamentary term has been marked by several resolutions, which were particularly ill-received by the Egyptian Parliament and numerous associations, I can only express my delight at concluding this final plenary session with good news for our relations with Egypt.\n",

This agreement with Egypt is problematic from several perspectives. Firstly, because it is once again merely a press statement and not an international agreement with the EU. The complete disregard for the European Parliament and, not least, its budgetary function, has evidently become standard practice for the Commission. Secondly, this agreement is potentially controversial, as it evidently has no legal force whatsoever, nor does it contain any safeguards regarding the respect for human rights. It is impossible to escape the impression that the Union is once again unconditionally financing an autocrat. Egypt is certainly a strategically extremely important country, also for Europe. But the Commission must cease such practices. We are aware of the challenges that Egypt is facing. And it is only right that Europe also helps its partners. But we must ask ourselves whether Europe is part of the solution or part of the problem. And at whose expense it concludes such agreements and who it might potentially harm. It would be unacceptable for Europe, without adequate safeguards, to contribute in any way to the violation of human rights and the suppression of democracy and the rule of law.

A full 200 million will be used to halt migrant departures, further externalising the control of European borders and ignoring human rights. This agreement was not only signed bypassing the scrutiny of the European Parliament, but it completely ignores the grave rule of law situation in Egypt. Indeed, cooperation with this country cannot be separated from our demand for human rights to be respected, by guaranteeing freedom of expression, releasing arbitrarily detained persons, and ending the repression of minorities. This was reminded to us just in these days, here in the European Parliament, by the presence of Patrick Zaki, detained for months by the Egyptian regime and now finally free, who told us: \"If I am here, it is because you too, in these chambers, believed that fighting for my freedom was a battle to be won.\" Giulio Regeni's parents also ask this of us, he who died more than eight years ago in Egypt and for whom we are still seeking the truth. A truth that the Egyptian authorities continue to cover up and which the Italian government and European authorities should demand with much greater force. Indeed, yes, fighting for freedom and for truth is a battle to be won. And as Europe, we must continue to do so. Certainly, the European Parliament must prevent this type of commitment from being hampered by agreements lacking monitoring and transparency, carried out by governments in an utterly unacceptable manner.\n",

These are three minutes in which some government in Europe will still be thinking about either sending support or a device for defence to Ukraine. Three minutes in which some broken Ukrainian family will be trying to cross the European border in order to seek security and peace. These are three minutes in which a life will be lost and we cannot recover it. I believe that our actions with CARE and CARE+ will help those running for their lives and will go down in history. It will go down in history that Europe showed solidarity and saved millions of lives, because we already have about 4 million on the territory of the European Union. But I think we should look further to make a step forward. What we need is a European Marshall Plan, a long—term mechanism which will recover and rebuild Ukraine after this horrible war that is going on there. I think this is the chance for Europe to not only show solidarity, but for European companies to rebuild Ukraine. And we will bring it back to a path of prosperity, peace and cooperation with the European Union – something that we should have been doing over the last 15 years at least. But I think we are on the right track now. I don’t know what the outcome of the votes later on today will be, but I am sure that neither I, nor any of us, would like to leave our home, our country and our life, just like most Ukrainians don’t want to.

We want them to receive support, housing, food, medical care, education, and everything they need. This should be done as unbureaucratically as possible and with 100% pre-financing, and I have a request for the Member States: Please make use of this opportunity, which is made possible by a high level of pre-financing from the European Union, and pass the money on to the cities and municipalities, which are currently working with dedication and accomplishing a great deal. But they also need our financial support. That is why it is so important that we adopt the proposal today. Furthermore, I have a request for the Commission, or rather, a call upon the Commission: The refugees will not be able to return in a few days or weeks. This means we must prepare for the fact that we will have to support cities and municipalities, Member States, and regions in the longer term.

      "\tMr Vice-President, Commissioner Dalli, millions of women, children, and the elderly have managed to flee the war in Ukraine. Many, however, remained at home, hoping it wouldn't be so bad. Unfortunately, we have seen civilians executed, women and children killed. The images from this weekend have, I believe, left their mark on all of us. We cannot turn back time to try and save them, but we can try to provide all the help they need to those who have reached us, in the countries of the European Union. Civil society has mobilised exemplarily in all states neighbouring Ukraine, but also in the states that refugees have transited or in which they have decided to stop, until the war ends. However, there is still a need for intervention from the authorities, for public support from funds that do not require the efforts of European citizens, citizens who have not yet recovered from the economic crisis and who have also been impacted by the energy crisis. We therefore understand very well that the funds made available to Member States need to be accessed as quickly and as easily as possible. And together with my colleagues from the Committee on Regional Development, I have supported this procedure. We also understand the immediate need to make their use more flexible and, especially, to increase the pre-financing rate, so that authorities have immediate access to these sums of money. However, it must be emphasised that these are European funds and, as such, must be verified and audited, just like all funds available to Member States. Even if we are in crisis situations, the European Parliament must have a say. We must be able to do our duty. Each European institution must exercise the role assigned to it by the treaties. Decisions taken bilaterally by the European Commission and the European Council must be the exception, resorted to only in extreme situations, because we, the institutions of the European Union, are the first to respect the levers of power, the system of checks and balances, as a sine qua non condition of democracy. We will have to find together, Commissioner, a way to oversee the use of funds under CARE and CARE+ to assure our citizens that all these funds have been used respecting both the letter and the spirit of the European regulations.

Our duty is to guarantee everyone shelter, food, access to education for children, access to healthcare, including reproductive and sexual health, and psychological support.

Having released a first aid package two weeks ago, we welcome this new Commission proposal to respond to a crisis whose evolution and scale remain uncertain. This mechanism will allow the mobilisation of available funds via React-EU to help the Member States hosting the most refugees fleeing the war. In the future too, we must rise to the challenge; the European Union must welcome refugees, not only Ukrainians, but all those who seek refuge in the European Union. This crisis must be an opportunity for us to rethink our migration policy and place respect for fundamental rights and the right to asylum back at its heart.

This figure is unfortunately set to increase in the coming weeks, given the prolonged nature of the conflict. This is an emergency that primarily concerns women and children and which has seen a great demonstration of welcome, particularly from certain states that are often instrumentally demonized even in this very Chamber, and I refer to Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Hungary, and Moldova. Indeed, several Member States are subjected to a high number of arrivals relative to the size of their population and a considerable organizational and economic effort, in the form of accommodation, social services, and transport. For this reason, our group, while aware that these resources may not be sufficient and may require further interventions in the coming weeks, as it previously did with the CARE package, strongly supports and has supported this measure and this procedure, considering them fundamental to increasing the pre-financing of REACT-EU to support Member States, but above all to continue demonstrating our closeness to the Ukrainian people. Once again, cohesion policy, as was already the case with the pandemic, proves to be the most effective and flexible policy with which to tackle emergencies and provide support to various Member States. And it is precisely because of this capacity that, I believe, a broader reflection is necessary, because it is clear that we need to build a structural solution to prevent these resources from continuing to be used in an extraordinary manner. An urgent structural solution that the Commission has a duty to find to be able to guarantee, in the face of a problem that will not be resolved in a few days or a few months, a constant solution and response.

Thousands of people arrive daily in my hometown, Berlin, too. Some initially use their 90-day tourist visa because they have not yet given up hope that the war, which derailed their entire lives, will soon be stopped. Yes, the application of the EU's Mass Influx Directive was a historic step, because the EU has finally decided to end the sell-off of its fundamental values. But it must also be said at this point: human rights are indivisible. This swift action would have been just as possible for people from the wars in Syria or Afghanistan. We should not so quickly forgive ourselves for needing the shock of the war in our neighbourhood to make us move faster. The compass of Europeans has finally settled back on solidarity. Now, many are once again experiencing what truly matters when people flee from bombs, repression, and persecution. It's about emergency accommodation, housing, jobs, immediate access to social benefits, linguistic support and integration, psychological services, and medical care – starting with vaccinations, because the pandemic has not disappeared. And last but not least: childcare and schooling bring a piece of peaceful everyday life back, especially for children and young people. However, in urban areas, housing is often lacking, while in rural areas, internet for learning is missing. And currently, energy and food prices are rising. To stabilize an infrastructure for accommodation and provision, CARE+, which we are deciding on today, is the best aid package. It simplifies procedures and releases funds. We have moved at lightning speed in this regard. And I wish that we would not understand this type of policy as a crisis mode, because there is no reasonable justification for the EU's austerity policy that has plagued us since 2008. Instead of constantly holding up the mirror of political incapacity to ourselves, we should permanently invest in solidarity. A migration-friendly infrastructure is the backbone of our democracy.

But to adequately respond to reception needs, Member States need more than the current funding programmes for migrant integration projects; they also need mechanisms similar to those that enabled swifter responses in combating the pandemic. In this regard, and as a way to support Member States in the additional challenges posed to their public budgets, the increase in pre-financing for REACT-EU resources proves to be of enormous importance; however, it should be seen in conjunction with other action measures. Let us not forget that this humanitarian crisis arrives at a time when Member States were still recovering from the COVID-19 pandemic and were more clearly beginning the transition to a greener, more digital, and fairer economic model, guided by the European Green Deal.\n",

We understand that we reached the agreement on this issue, but unfortunately we have not tabled our proposals for these plenary sessions. And it’s quite sad and strange that, as a rapporteur for Azerbaijan who is preparing a report that will be voted in AFET in forthcoming sessions, we will reduce the serious issue of the Lachin corridor only to 500 words. And I think it’s these urgencies that will be debated and discussed this session. I ask all our colleagues to be a bit more serious about the issue and ask for a full debate. I do not know if this can be changed, but this issue requires a full debate at these plenary sessions because the humanitarian situation there is dire.\n",

      "\tMadam President, under Rule 152 I am requesting that the EU—PNR Directive, which is legally and technically ready, be voted this week. This request and a possible roll call vote today is not about the merits of PNR; those have been debated. Today is simply about giving this House its right to vote without an undue delay. Some in this House talk a lot about democracy and transparency, but at the end of the day this Parliament loses credibility with the backroom deals of a few who try to manipulate our agenda to further their own political aims and priorities. The public loses faith in politics because of games, tactics and vested interests. We are a democracy; if you do not like something you vote against it and then you justify that to your electorate. You do not delay or stop it from being voted at all. My request is simple: please give me my right as rapporteur and elected Member, representing my constituents, to have a vote on this directive this week. I agree with the proposal that there should be a debate at 8.30 tomorrow morning and a vote later this week.\n",
      "[ ] 3: Alain Lamassoure (PPE - christian_conservative) [2% migration]\n",
      "\tMadam President, the security of the European Union is seriously compromised by the most insane form of terrorism we have ever known. Thousands of European citizens participate in these attacks, most often going to the Middle East for training and returning home. Over the past ten years, hundreds of Europeans have fallen into these conditions. There is general agreement that it is by developing a common European air passenger file that we will be able to trace their movements as best as possible and prevent future attacks. We worked there for three years. On such a sensitive subject, the 28 governments agreed and our competent committee, which worked extensively on this agreement, itself gave its approval. This agreement balances the requirements of security and the requirements of safeguarding individual freedoms. Some of our colleagues had hoped that the negotiation on the regulation relating to the protection of personal data would be advanced at the same time. This prerequisite is now lifted. In the meantime, new massacres took place in Paris and, since then, the threat has continued to worsen with migratory chaos. Under these conditions, a real speed race is underway between terrorists and our democracies. We can no longer put forward procedural quibbles to delay our decision. As the rapporteur said, it is now that each group, each MEP must take their responsibilities and, publicly vis-à-vis European citizens, say what priority they give or do not give to the fight against the most barbaric form of terrorism.\n",
      "[ ] 4: Enrique Guerrero Salom (PSE/S&D - social_democratic) [0% migration]\n",
      "\tMadam President, in general terms I appreciate Mr. Lamassoure's arguments, but I believe that the concept of \"procedural tricks\" does not correspond to the position of those of us who consider that this matter cannot be separated from data protection. I would like to point out that this is not just a question of the position of one political group or another, but that there has been, for months, a fairly established consensus in the European Parliament on the convenience of providing instruments for security but also for the protection of personal privacy. And, therefore, our position has not simply been strategic, of preserving one issue so that the other is also approved, but it is a question of values. And that is why, when Mr Kirkhope pointed out that European citizens expect us to provide them with security, an important part of this Parliament has to say that they also expect us to protect their privacy, and for that reason we are not against that the PNR be approved: we are in favor of it being approved at the same time as data protection, because it is the balance we need to preserve security and freedom. (Parliament rejected the request)\n",
      "[ ] 5: Rebecca Harms (Greens/EFA - green) [11% migration]\n",
      "\tDear Madam President, dear colleagues! The European Union's policy on Turkey in recent years has been short-sighted, to say the least, and it took tens of thousands of refugees to remind us how important this country is to the European Union. But we are now again in danger of adopting a really short-sighted policy towards Turkey. It's not that we're against seeking an understanding with the refugees - that's how it has to be. But we as the Green Party consider it completely irresponsible if we now enter a new phase of negotiations and ignore the internal escalation in Turkey and the abandonment of any rule of law. The violent – one has to say – occupation and takeover of Turkey's largest daily newspaper last weekend and actually immediately before the summit in Brussels cannot be accepted. We must discuss this in this House, we must discuss this with Mrs Mogherini. Nor can it be accepted that the escalation in southeast Turkey continues completely undeterred. There are two sides involved. But this spiral of escalation must end. What Kati Piri, Knut Fleckenstein and others, including my colleagues, have reported from the southeast is completely unacceptable. Since there is now repeated talk on the sidelines of the summit about recognizing Turkey as a safe third country, I ask you: Can we allow this without debate? What we are seeing already shows that many Turkish citizens will need political asylum in the near future if we do not explicitly try to address this from our side. I ask you to support our request not to simply discuss these issues within the summit, but to expressly discuss these issues in the perspective of the newly launched negotiation initiative with Turkey.\n",
      "[ ] 6: Marie-Christine Vergiat (NGL/The Left - left) [0% migration]\n",
      "\tMadam President, I rise to support Mrs Harms' proposal. I returned from Türkiye yesterday. The testimonies we received there are overwhelming. It is true that journalists are persecuted: at least 67 journalists, according to government sources, including those from Zaman, the main opposition newspaper put under supervision, which reappeared yesterday curiously displaying a pro-government line, but also journalists from Cumhuriyet, another opposition newspaper. We visited the Armutlu district, the main Alevi district of the city of Istanbul, where we met the family of young Dilek Dogan, who was coldly murdered by the police as she returned to her apartment. There are also the academics: 300 have just been indicted for terrorism for the sole reason that they had denounced the situation in the South-East. Precisely the South-East, where there are more than 768 Kurds who have been murdered since July, including 98 children and 87 women – terrorists undoubtedly! 255 just in Cizre in conditions which are unbearable, which are even unworthy of the international law of war. We all fear that this will happen again in Sur, the historic capital, the historic old town, where the main Armenian church in the region is located. We therefore call for a debate and we think it is time to have one on the human rights situation in Turkey.\n",
      "[ ] 7: Cristian Dan Preda (PPE - christian_conservative) [0% migration]\n",
      "\tMadam President, we are very concerned about the situation of the press in Turkey and the crazy agitation in universities. But we do not consider it necessary to have a separate debate tomorrow, as the Green group is proposing. The reason is very simple: Wednesday morning, if you look at the agenda, we have in the program a debate on Turkey, and in particular on today's meeting between the 28 heads of state or government and the Prime Minister. Turkish minister. Moreover, the President of our Parliament has just sent us, around thirty minutes ago, a note explaining that the question of Zaman in particular has already been raised by himself and by the representatives of the Member States.

      "[ ] 8: Gabriele Zimmer (NGL/The Left - left) [15% migration]\n",
      "\tAs a group, we have requested that the item on the situation in Kazakhstan be postponed to the April part-session during the emergency debate on Thursday and instead include a debate and a resolution on the violations of human rights obligations in the context of the forced evacuation of the Calais jungle. You all know that numerous accommodations in the Calais refugee camp have been forcibly evacuated since last week. Volunteers and NGOs on the ground have also reported that there has been a high level of violence by French security forces as they have taken people out of their homes, despite assurances that the approach would be gradual and gradual I will refrain from using force. That's exactly why we want to have this debate here. We know that many people are desperate. You have probably also seen the pictures of people having their mouths sewn shut as a protest against the forced eviction. I think it would be important for us as a Parliament to agree on this. Finally, a remark: There was always something like a rumor here that there was a gentlemen's agreement that no human rights violations within the European Union should be discussed in the emergency debate, but that there had to be special agenda items for this. I would like to speak to the President of Parliament, who has stated that human rights violations cannot be classified geographically. And if we have a special agenda item that involves human rights violations, then we should have an open ear and clear eyes for it, especially when human rights violations within the EU need to be addressed, and we should do that here too.\n",
      "[x] 9: Molly Scott Cato (Greens/EFA - green) [27% migration]\n",
      "\tMadam President, I am very grateful to Ms Zimmer for suggesting this because I think it is indeed essential that we take very seriously violations of human rights in our own continent and I believe that is exactly what is happening in the Calais camp. I visited there myself quite recently and I was really shocked to see the way the British and French Governments were not taking seriously the needs of the asylum seekers who were there. We believe very strongly that the British Government should be registering refugees in that camp and should not be relying on the fact that Britain is outside Schengen and that they cannot reach Britain to register. We believe a lot of the refugees there actually have rights to come and be reunited with their families in Britain under the Dublin Agreement and my government is simply not taking those rights seriously. I believe that the destruction of their homes is actually a violation of their right to shelter under the UN Convention on Human Rights and I think it is very essential that as a parliament we take seriously these violations of human rights within our own continent, so I entirely support the proposal that we should debate this as one of the urgencies.\n",
      "[ ] 10: Diane James (EDD/INDDEM/EFD - (extreme)_right) [11% migration]\n",
      "\tMadam President, I cannot support the suggestion in this proposal this afternoon for the following reasons: the Calais jungle is a result of the Le Touquet Agreement, which is an accord between the French Government and the UK Government, and the European Union has no right to interfere with that. Secondly, the enforced closure of part of the migrant camp, the Jungle, was on the basis of a French decision taken in a French law court. We have no right whatsoever to interfere with French judicial process. The third item – and I would like to ask everyone to take this into consideration – is that one of the many reasons why the migrants reacted as they did was one anarchist supported by a British charity, and I do not think we ought to support anarchists’ and activists’ work. The last point is that a lot of these migrants do not want their fingerprints to be taken. That was another reason why they reacted with the violence they did. There is absolutely no way this Chamber should take any stance on this position. It is down to a situation between the UK and French Governments. (Parliament rejected the request)\n",

      "\tMadam President, I rise to express my consternation that the crisis in the pigmeat sector has been put up for debate at 15.00 on a Thursday afternoon. When pig farmers throughout Europe are facing serious financial difficulties, this is a slap in the face that the Conference of Presidents has given to the coordinators of the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development who asked for this debate – to actively highlight this – and when we will not even have a Commission representative there. So this is totally unacceptable and I hope you will have a rethink.\n",

The only exception will be travel for the purpose of performing paid work, for which a work visa will still be required.

According to the rapporteur, the countries covered by these agreements do not represent a threat, either in terms of irregular migration or in terms of security. In view of the mass immigration that we are experiencing and which the Union is no longer capable of managing, in view of the risks and the recent attacks of which France has just been the victim, we can only be surprised, even worry about this sudden desire for openness.

The list of countries whose citizens can travel to the EU without a visa is included in the Annex to Regulation No. 539/2001, and until now the visa-free regime was usually introduced by amending this Annex. Considering that some member states may already have concluded bilateral agreements on visa-free travel from an earlier period, and these agreements may make it difficult to implement the basic rule allowing stays in the Schengen area for only 90 days in every 180 days, it was decided to conclude as part of the introduction of visa-free relations with third countries, EU visa-free agreements, which will clearly replace national visa-free agreements and reflect the 90 in 180 rule.\n",

One of the important areas of collaboration is that of visa-free travel for short periods of stay. Those periods refer, in particular, to tourist stays or business trips. The elimination of the visa regime constitutes a significant boost for the development of the tourism field. The Pacific area is a developing region that benefits from excellent natural conditions for tourism activities at any time of the year. Eliminating the need for visas for European citizens would facilitate organizational efforts and increase the number of European tourists in the states of the region, with significant effects for the respective states' economies. The benefits would be mutual, allowing our citizens easier access to vacations in this region of the world.

Many of us hope that new chapters in negotiations will be opened so that both Serbia and other Balkan countries will soon become members. The problem is that you falter. There is still an idea that Serbia can have two mothers, both the EU and Russia, because while Serbia is reaching out to the EU, it has not followed the EU's foreign policy towards Russia. They have allowed Russia to dominate Serbia's energy market and thus exposed themselves to future pressures. It is preparing a joint military exercise with Russia and supports the statements aimed at dividing Bosnia and Herzegovina. Therefore, it feels important to add to the report an encouragement to Serbia to continue on the chosen path of rapprochement with the EU. That is where Serbia's future lies. Likewise, it feels important to encourage the Commission to help Serbia be able to detach itself from Russia. Serbia can be the EU's bridge to Russia, but then it must first be part of the EU.

However, there remain several aspects of the country's political and social life that are still worrying, such as the lack of progress on media freedom of expression and deficiencies in respect for human and minority rights.

Consider reforms in the judicial and political system, Serbia's recognition of the existence of Kosovo, labor reforms, privatizations, restructuring of the public sector, protection of private investment, budgetary reform, impositions under the functioning of institutions, cooperation with the International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia. The successive enlargements of the EU have allowed large economic and financial groups to expand the Community internal market, allowing them to dominate new economies, creating new opportunities for the exploitation of a qualified, low-cost workforce.

The rapporteur accepted most of the amendments that I submitted with my colleagues from the Croatian EPP delegation, where I particularly emphasize the issue of the status of the Croatian national minority in Vojvodina and the problem of missing persons. I am also satisfied because our colleagues in the European Parliament have begun to understand how problematic the Law on the Organization and Jurisdiction of State Bodies in War Crimes Proceedings is, by which Serbia abuses the principle of universal jurisdiction, as evidenced by the amendment of the author of the resolution itself, which was adopted today, and by which this the issue became international. In the case of Serbia, the European Commission can no longer push problems under the carpet, but must start solving them.

I support the contents of the motion, which encourages Serbia to prepare a separate action plan for the situation of national minorities. The settlement of the minority situation in the Western Balkans is not necessary because of the European Union, it cannot be a mandatory task to be carried out as a result of external pressure, but must be an expression of an internal demand that can steer the processes in the direction of normality.

      "\tMadam President, dear Evelyn, congratulations from me on becoming Vice President, dear colleagues! Dear Commissioner, I'm going to ask you two simple questions tonight, and I think you'd actually like to answer no to these simple questions. But I ask the first question: Is this German car toll compliant with EU law? At this point I would also like to quote a proven expert on these questions, who said: A road user fee is only compliant with EU law if it does not discriminate on the basis of nationality. It's not me saying that, it's what you said, Commissioner Bulc, at the start of the infringement procedure in June 2015. Accordingly, let us start from this principle. Has this discrimination now been eliminated through the supposed agreement? Not in my opinion. As before, EU foreigners are still burdened more heavily than German citizens. Or simply put: A Belgian driver with a Euro 6 car pays the toll, a German driver does not. Hence the answer to the first question “Is the new German toll model compliant with EU law?”: No, it is not. I come to the second question: Is this toll a symbol of good European cooperation? Here too the answer: No, it is not. There is currently no European toll system. This toll violates the fundamental principles of our Union, which you and the Commission must protect. There should not be the feeling that our European partners are financing Germany's roads at the expense of their neighbors. Because then what would be the result? The long-term consequence would be that we would undermine the basic principles of the internal market and coexistence in Europe. That's why this toll must have no place in Europe, especially not in our time when so many doubt the EU. Ms. Bulc, you have it in your hands. The process is currently on hold. Therefore, an urgent appeal to you: continue the infringement procedure, otherwise Member States will sue. And have no doubt: this idea is gaining more and more support because it is about more than just tolls, it is about the fundamental principles of our European Union.\n",

Firstly, the Commission seems to have problems applying the same standards to large Member States as to small ones. As a reminder: In Europe it is still really the strength of the law and not the law of the strongest that counts. Secondly: After the submission to the Bundestag, Commission President Juncker personally announced in May 2015 that the toll would be examined due to significant doubts regarding European law. In September 2016 the Commission decided to refer Germany to the European Court of Justice and on 3 An agreement was then surprisingly announced in November. Commissioner, what has changed? I still pay more for the same car on the same route just because I have an Austrian license plate, regardless of the emissions class. Discrimination is still discrimination. Thirdly: Although Transport Minister Dobrindt deserves another European thistle in his collection, I would also like to take a stand for the German approach. If there is a European solution as part of the revision of the Eurovignette Directive, then national taxes must go down. But if – as in the present case – only the neighboring countries should bear the burden for German taxpayers, then that is not acceptable. The Commission is called upon to take a closer look. Cross-border mobility should not and must not be punished. Drivers, regardless of nationality, are not fair game for finance ministers and populists – see Article 18. I hope the Commission will reconsider its position.\n",

But you now have to represent what was ultimately agreed at a higher level - between Mr. Juncker and Ms. Merkel - in order to smoke a peace pipe within the federal government, within the CDU and the CSU, and at least in one problematic area, namely the foreigner toll to put away. Nevertheless, dear Commissioner, the questions that Mrs Schmidt just asked are still on the table. I would like to recall that we spoke to each other repeatedly at the beginning of this period, when this proposal was on the table. We have discussed all of these components and ultimately they still do not contribute to making the whole thing, which started as a foreigners' toll on the part of the CSU, ultimately compliant with European law. It is still the case that you have just admitted that there will not be one-to-one compensation for German drivers. And you continue to admit that it ultimately has to conform to the user and polluter principle. So I ask myself: Where does this proposal correspond to this user and polluter principle? And I would also like to ask you, Commissioner: What did the European Commission get in return? Is it true that the European Commission has thereby bought, or at least bought, the Federal Republic of Germany's consent to the EETS legislation? Is that right? Yes or no? And also, say quite openly: Why did this statement or at least this deal ultimately take place exactly in the week in which the CSU party conference took place in Bavaria?

Initially, you said, Commissioner, that it would be better to negotiate with the German Government before the measure became law; now, when it has become law, you are waiting to think what to do. I think there is a contradiction in that statement. Other possible reasons could be that the Commission made legal mistakes when it started infringement proceedings – and if that is not the case, I would like more information about the changes – or that the German Government has made enough political statements to remove discrimination against car owners from other countries and drivers of environment-friendly cars?

This is an article from Lower Saxony and the Netherlands in the border area together. The fact is that our state government – I come from this part of Germany – is completely against introducing this toll. The fact is: we have a Euregio region right in the border area with the Netherlands. It was deliberately set up to have cross-border traffic and work. There are many people who live in the Netherlands and work in Lower Saxony. There are more jobs here in Lower Saxony, so there are more people there who can fill the jobs. This is massively undermined. There is not enough public transport, you have to rely on the car and that means only some people pay and others don't. It is also the case that thanks to the German toll, if you have an environmentally friendly car - which in principle is not a bad thing, Euro 6 - you can even earn money from the toll. Mr. Dobrindt still says today: The Germans no longer pay. That means: Who pays for it then? The question is, of course, from a German perspective: Is there even enough income? Isn't this perhaps a zero-sum game? But we have to discuss this in Germany. In general, I actually think that this principle user pays, polluter pays is of course good. It would be best if we had no car tax at all, everywhere in all European countries, and you only pay whenever you drive. That would be the fairest and best thing. Of course, that's not possible at the moment because we can't simply say: everyone has to abolish vehicle tax. But what we have on the table now is actually not a good blueprint. Last thing: It's not mileage-based either, it's not like you pay for every mile. There are still different sections – month and so on. That's not what we need and it's far too bureaucratic.\n",

However, I firmly believe that we must demand from the German side – and I am asking you to do it not only in the form of words, but concrete actions on the part of the Commission – so that it does not do so in a way that is discriminatory towards drivers from other member countries. I consider the German toll concept to be discriminatory because it means that all Germans will be reimbursed to a large extent and only foreigners will de facto pay the tolls. I want to declare here that if it is confirmed that there will be negative discriminatory effects for the member countries, the court should also discuss this issue, and not just the European Parliament. We only ask for fair terms that will be the same for all parties.

As early as 1990, the then Transport Minister Zimmermann wanted to implement the truck toll and reduce the vehicle tax for trucks. Did the Commission say no? In 1992 the European Court of Justice said: This is anti-European. With that it was buried. In 2004, the then federal government wanted to try the same thing. The Commission said again: This is anti-European. It was then introduced anyway. Now Alexander Dobrindt comes with his third attempt. I always say: mistakes make you wise. But for Alexander Dobrindt two weren't enough. Why is it so? The toll is anti-European; it prevents cross-border traffic. It costs. Only foreigners pay – not Germans. That doesn't work. In addition, the vignette is unecological and anti-social because someone who drives 10,000 kilometers a year pays exactly as much as someone who drives 200,000 kilometers. That has nothing at all to do with the user and polluter pays principle. That's why it has to be stopped, and I can't understand why the Commission initially said: This is anti-European, and then, after Juncker met with the CSU in Bavaria - passing by the Commissioner, by the way - that everything should then be legal . That doesn't work. The Bundestag still has to decide on it. But if he decides to do that, then I think, because it's anti-social, then not only the SPD but also the CSU would have to delete the S in their name, because that's totally anti-social.\n",

You are breaking - not bending - your own rules that you have decided, just because it is politically convenient. That – and I can tell you this – certainly does not create trust in this Union.

We in the PPE do not oppose charging tolls, just as we do not want tolls in the Netherlands, that must be clear.

It is difficult to understand the behavior of the Commission, which, despite the first appropriate reaction, suspended the procedure for clarifying objections to the compliance of this idea with European law, although the main objection is still valid.

And now about the alleged discrimination. I cannot recognize this, and the Commissioner rightly stated it: every user of our German motorways should pay in the future, and I emphasize: every user - regardless of their nationality. The question of tax was also raised. Reducing vehicle tax is a matter for the Member States. In Austria there is also a commuter allowance. There is also a tax break for drivers driving in Austria. That's fine. That's okay with us too. A final word about our Austrian friends. Dear colleagues, if I drive from Munich to Bolzano at the weekend, I only pay just under 40 euros for road use.

      "\tMadam President, 44 years of conflict make Afghanistan one of the worst humanitarian catastrophes in the world. But the Taliban's seizure of power on 15 August 2021 marked a return to the situation that characterized the country 20 years ago, nullifying the few advances made in human rights and, above all, women's rights. Systematically, their access to education has been denied. Even access to healthcare is only open to women if they are accompanied by a guardian. The Taliban have established a system that Afghan women activists have called a gender apartheid regime. This debate is all the more timely and necessary today because, on the morning of 23 March, the Taliban communicated to Afghan female students over the age of twelve that their doors would remain closed. In this Parliament, we have listened to and exchanged with many extraordinary women such as Shaharzad Akbar or Sima Samar, both presidents of the Afghan Independent Human Rights Commission, or Zarifa Ghafari, mayor of Maidan Shar, and still others. They shared with us their strong concerns on several points, such as their fear regarding what they perceive as a dangerous normalisation of the relationship with the Taliban, and the duplicity of the Taliban, who presented themselves as open to dialogue while, at the same time, brutally demonstrating their refusal to engage with democratic civic space. They also shared with us the destruction of the social fabric and the lack of accountability of this brutal regime. Through this resolution, we reaffirm that taking power through violence and arms does not make the Taliban legitimate; that the European Union's intervention in Afghanistan will ensure that women are involved in the planning, monitoring, and management of aid programmes; that we will ensure access to quality education; that we will show no tolerance for corruption or discrimination; that we will ensure that civil society and the media are protected. We commit to granting protection status to Afghan women refugees. We commit to finding adapted approaches to help and support women in Afghanistan who could not or did not wish to leave the country.\n",

Women and girls are effectively no longer able to receive an education, participate in public life, or no longer have full access to their bodies, their voice and their future. It is difficult to comprehend. Seemingly overnight, the Taliban has undone over 20 years of progress in the sphere of human rights and female empowerment. And today, women are once again second class citizens in Afghanistan. I stand in solidarity with the Afghan women who, in the face of state violence and arrest, protest and stand up to the de facto Taliban authorities and continue to actively demand the freedom, democracy and equal representation that they rightly deserve. The Taliban regime, which has forcibly taken control of Afghanistan, must adhere to the five benchmarks set out by the Council in order for future new engagement. And the West must present a united front and continue to push the de facto government into respecting the rule of law, human rights and, in particular, women’s rights. Otherwise, we cannot trust them to act responsibly with the human aid that we provide. We have to continue to express our support for Afghan women and girls. We have to give them the hope and we have to fight for their future. This is why, together with my colleagues, we put forward a proposal for the 2023 EU budget to provide funding to the Afghan online university. We believe it is important that Afghans in Afghanistan and abroad in refugee camps continue with their education despite poverty and oppression.\n",

But let us not make the mistake we make so often of jumping from crisis to crisis and forgetting about the rest of the world. Just last summer, our anger and frustration were targeted at the Taliban takeover, which has turned Afghan lives into absolute hell. The Taliban is showing its real face as a brutal oppressor and a jailer of women and girls. More than 4 million girls are stuck at home, while women are deprived of their right to work, to study and to travel freely. Girls face forced marriages. And formal official or government members, journalists, human rights defenders and minorities are attacked, detained and killed. We must prioritise their human rights by making tough demands towards the Taliban, by reaching out to protect them. The Taliban takeover has also made the lives of all Afghan people extremely dire. More than 24 million people depend on humanitarian aid, and the drought, pandemic and the freezing of international aid have deepened this crisis. The Russian invasion has even increased food insecurity due to skyrocketing grain prices. We must ensure that sanctions effectively target the Taliban, without undermining the basic socioeconomic rights of the poor Afghan people, by creating alternative ways to reach them and by stepping up humanitarian aid. Because if we do not act now, we risk more people dying from the humanitarian crisis in the country than from the last 20 years of conflict. Many people are at immediate risk of persecution in Afghanistan, and they need our support to leave the country and be protected elsewhere. I call upon the High Representative and the Commission to step up the coordination for evacuation and to press Member States to enhance their visa and resettlement policies. We must invest in the better protection of refugees in neighbouring countries. But let’s be fair: there is a clear need for safe passage to our embassies and the European Union as well. Let us make sure that Afghan refugees are welcomed and protected, not pushed back and let down. Our solidarity with the Ukrainian refugees has shown that we are able to do it.

In Afghanistan, US sanctions currently imposed on the country, and the theft of the US of more than USD 7 billion of the country’s assets, are on track to take the lives of more civilians in the coming year than the illegal NATO war took in 20 years. Over 25 million people, 55% of the Afghan population, are facing high levels of acute food insecurity. 1 million children may starve.

And that’s what the Taliban, the all-male leadership are afraid of – because they don’t want a brighter future for Afghanistan, its women and children. They want a subjugated people they can control. Afghanistan will never be free until we let girls learn. So if the Taliban don’t do it for us, we must help Afghan women and girls build their country’s brighter future.

Afghanistan, with its immense and arid mountains, with its turbaned men with piercing gazes, and with its endless poppy fields. We have grown up or grown old with Afghanistan at war, with the USSR, with Bernard Kouchner, with Commander Massoud and the Taliban on television, and then, this summer, with the Americans who fled this land of war overnight. This sudden return to customs of another era reminds us of our inability to implant women's rights in distant societies where many fundamentally reject our way of life. What did the Americans do there for all these years? Did they truly believe that by changing the regime, they could change Afghan society as a whole? They left Afghanistan in ruins. They left this country in the hands of the Taliban. 'When houses were locked from the inside, American soldiers would batter them down with battering rams, forcibly removing women's veils,' wrote Emmanuel Razavi, a veteran reporter, this summer. So, I think of all these Afghan women who, ultimately, are paying for our arrogance in believing that we can impose our way of life on the entire planet. It is our collective failure. 2 trillion dollars were invested in Afghanistan by the United States over the last 20 years, with 500 billion of that used to pay the interest on the debt. France lost 90 soldiers and had 700 wounded there. Who knows if 1 trillion more euros could change this country? Who knows if another 1000 amputee soldiers could change this country? I see that some colleagues are organising a flashmob tomorrow in solidarity with these Afghan women. Do you really think a flashmob will change this country?

But I must admit that we have not seen the same unified response when other human rights atrocities took place in third countries. For months, the situation in Afghanistan has been deteriorating. In particular, the profound violations of women’s rights are becoming more frequent. Just a few days ago, the ban on girls going to school was reinstated. Atefa, a 16—year—old Afghan girl, in an effort to express her despair, stated that: ‘for Afghan girls, the earth is unbearable, and the sky is unreachable’. Depriving education from these girls is like depriving them of their future. The EU is committed to defend human rights around the world, but its efforts will not be strengthened until democracy and human rights are absolutely assured in every state, including Afghanistan. Afghan women and girls are crying out for immediate help, not words of condemnation. Let’s keep little Atefa’s words in mind and make the earth bearable for her and the sky reachable to her.\n",

Unfortunately, this primarily affects women and girls, who number almost 20 million in that country. It is unjustifiable that the Taliban has banned education for girls above the sixth grade, thus robbing them of the chance for a full life in the future. Education for all, without distinction, is the foundation for the development of any society; 87% of Afghans support equal education, and therefore the European Union must exert diplomatic pressure to ensure education is accessible to everyone. We must also push for the reopening of shelters for victims of domestic violence, so that women do not have to return to their abusers; some are now facing death for having left their homes. And we must not forget the absolutely inadequate care for persons with disabilities. The EU must do everything possible to help people with disabilities in the country and at the same time prepare a new programme so that these people can seek proper care with us, in the European Union.\n",

Our initial shock here in the EU at how rapidly the Taliban seized control has passed. But this atmosphere of desperation and fear in Afghanistan has not. The Taliban made many empty promises after their takeover that they would offer full amnesty to Afghans who worked for the Western—backed government and uphold women’s rights. No sooner were these promises made than they were broken. I’m in contact with an Afghan woman and her family who tell me of their precarious situation with their rights and freedoms severely restricted and living in isolation. On 23 March, a glimmer of hope was soon extinguished when the Taliban ordered girls secondary schools to shut just hours after they had reopened for the first time. Many students were crying as they were turned away from their classes. As a former teacher, I am horrified by this denial of education and, by extension, denial of a future. The international community must increase its pressure on the Taliban to ensure that not only are girls allowed to return to school as soon as possible, but also that the curriculum will provide them with a genuine education.

The European Union will be strong if it will be based on those values without compromises, if it will be based on those values not only here in the European Parliament or in some other EU institutions, but also on a national, regional and local level. This is the only way how those values can be established also on the whole European continent. Why is it so important to talk about those basic principles and values? Because this is the only way how sustainable peace can be established on the European continent, since there is a very well—known law of geopolitics: only democracies are not fighting with each other. That is why defence of those values everywhere in our Union and the spread of democracy and basic human values into the eastern side of European continent is the most important strategic geopolitical goal for all of us, and especially during this war. We need to recognise, all of us in the European Union: we are not perfect back home in this area. There are things which we need to improve and to strengthen, also in Lithuania. But today I want to elaborate on what our President was speaking about. What should our common strategic agenda be in order to assist the nations in the eastern part of the European continent to enjoy the same European values of democracy and human rights? I want to repeat: sustainable peace on European continent will be established only when Belarusian and Russian people will have a possibility to enjoy those values and to live in normal European conditions. Such a strategic agenda will be implemented only if we shall proceed with a very clear strategic action plan. First, Ukraine needs to decisively defeat Putin’s Russia during this year, and that will create possibilities for big political changes in Russia and Belarus. Our most important obligation: weapons, weapons, weapons… and sanctions. Second, the absolute geopolitical priority for you during this year: to start membership negotiations with Ukraine and Moldova. That would be the most powerful European geopolitical answer to Kremlin hybrid offensive activities in the region, especially in Moldova and perhaps also in Georgia. Third, the integration of Ukraine, Moldova and possibly Georgia towards the EU should be concluded till the end of this decade, since that is the only way how successful and prosperous democracies can be created in those countries. The success of those countries would be an inspiration for Belarusian and Russian societies to follow. Fourth, Ukraine needs to get membership in NATO, if not during the Vilnius summit this year, then during the Washington summit next year. It would help Russian people to abandon their dream to restore empire because Ukraine will be gone. Fifth, the EU needs to show clear perspective. Democratic Belarus will have possibility to integrate into the EU. Democratic Russia will have a special and very practical relationship with the EU. We Lithuanians want to be part of a European Union which is able to implement such a democracy action plan because this is an action plan for sustainable peace on the European continent.\n",

Today, Ukraine is in this same position, heroically fighting for its own freedom and ours. It is fighting against the same aggressor, only with a changed name. It is therefore no surprise that from the first day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine until now, the voice of Lithuania and other Baltic States has been the loudest, urging not only the provision of urgent and comprehensive assistance to Ukraine, but also demanding a common and united European Union response to stop Russia's aggression. Here and now. Allow me to remind you that for many years, Lithuania and other Baltic States consistently spoke and warned about the true face of Russia and the objectives of its authoritarian Putin regime. Unfortunately, not all members of the European community were willing to heed these warnings. However, these warnings have become a bloody reality for the people of Ukraine. Today, everyone has acknowledged that the discourse of Lithuania and the Baltic States concerning the bloody objectives of the Kremlin regime was not merely an airing of historical grievances. We did this because we knew how fragile freedom is and how immense its price is, and we aimed to prevent this from happening again in Europe, and to ensure that no nation would ever experience brutal oppression and an assault on its territorial integrity and freedom. Never. I fully agree with our President. Historical memory must not be relegated to the archives. History must not be forgotten, and the war initiated by Putin bears witness to this once again. Therefore, I call upon us to be responsible, united, and courageous, to establish a tribunal for Russia's war crimes, to take all possible actions and impose sanctions to weaken the power of the Kremlin regime, and to help Ukraine win this brutal war, as this is also a guarantor of Europe's long-term security. We must be united in restoring and expanding our defensive capabilities – our security as Europeans will depend on how we pursue this together, jointly, and in a concerted manner. Distinguished colleagues, a strong and resilient Europe can only exist when it is united, socially responsible, just, and progressive. Our goal as socialists and democrats is to strengthen Europe's social foundation and to ensure that the objectives approved at the Porto Summit are fully implemented in all member states. A Social Europe must ensure that even those on minimal incomes can live with dignity and support their families, rather than falling into poverty; that there are no children living in poverty, of whom we still have over 18 million in Europe today; that men and women receive equal pay for the same work; that our pensioners enjoy a dignified old age; and that the rights and freedoms of all people are protected. Only a socially strong, resilient, and responsible Europe will be able to cope with challenges such as the green transition and digitalization, which will inevitably impact Europe's socio-economic model and labor market.

      "\tMadam President, first of all I wish to welcome the President to the European Parliament and, most importantly – even if we are a bit late – to say ‘Happy Independence Restoration Day’ to Lithuania, of course. More than anything, colleagues, the full—scale invasion of Ukraine has confirmed the need for European unity. And it is true that only together, as Europeans, can we stand up against the brutal imperialism of the Russian regime. We have shown here in the European Parliament that we stand for unwavering solidarity with Ukraine, be it financial, humanitarian, or military support, paving the way for Ukraine to become a member of the European Union. But of course, and you have mentioned it, Mr President, we need full energy independence of the brutal Russian regime. For too long politicians also, and especially from my home country, Germany, have ignored the alert for from our eastern neighbours, like, for example, Lithuania, and now we are paying a high price for this. But colleagues, one thing has to be understood. Simply switching from one energy dependency on one dictatorship to another will not solve any of our problems. Nor does the shift from one fossil fuel dependency to another non-renewable energy source. The only sustainable answer that will prevent us from having the exact same problem that we have been facing in the last year again, in two, five or ten years is to make our energy consumption 100% renewable. That is possible and we have no time to lose. No country in the European Union will manage this alone. Only a strong European Green Deal can make that possible. You are absolutely right. The Green Deal for long already has not only been a measure that we need to protect our climate or to stimulate our economy, it has become the most crucial measure also for strong security in the European continent. But, Mr President, the fight against authoritarianism does not only happen, unfortunately, outside of the European Union. We also have to stay vigilant inside because we can see attempts of undermining our democracy, of undermining separation of powers, rule of law and fundamental rights in the European Union, brutal attacks on press freedom and journalists. We cannot stay silent in the European Union on these developments because the EU is not only a community of trade – we share fundamental values. If we want the EU to be strong and true to its own values, we have to protect all our citizens from these attacks, no matter whether they are from Lithuania or Portugal, no matter their gender, their skin colour or their sexual orientation. Because safeguarding freedom and human dignity means safeguarding freedom and human dignity for all.\n",

      "\tEsteemed Mr. President! Today's war in Ukraine poses a threat to international security and is the cause of an economic crisis. Lasting peace is a supreme value. Lasting peace is also essential, as is solidarity, which would allow us to survive this difficult time. However, there is a big problem today with European solidarity, because some large countries pursue their own, egoistic policies. The Union is also experiencing a crisis of values, those values that once built the Community, and from which we are unfortunately departing. I am saying this primarily to the EU institutions, where there is no development of democracy and free political thought. Unfortunately, an artificial power arrangement blocks the development of freedom, blocks in defiance of democracy, as the will of a large part of the electorate, up to 50%, is rejected. Today's arrangement unites a single goal – power at any cost and the division of \"posts\". This is a peculiar usurpation of democracy. The two main forces in this Parliament – the EPP and the Socialists – although theoretically having different programmes, have for years united immediately after elections to exclude a third force, and in this way do not have to deliver on their programmes. The Socialists promise social programmes but do not implement them. They promise to care for the poorest but support CO2 emissions trading, which causes price increases and the impoverishment of people. The EPP declares that it upholds Christian values, but does not defend life from conception to natural death, does not protect marriage understood as a union between a woman and a man, and often supports gender ideology, which has nothing to do with true Christian Democracy. Additionally, both forces impose the creation of an EU federation, which destroys the Europe of nations that it was intended to be in the vision of its founders, Schuman and others. Unfortunately, this artificial political arrangement blocks free thought and ideas. The EPP-Socialist arrangement does not allow for any alternative, the so-called third force. Such a system encourages political corruption, which we are witnessing in Parliament. This harmful and undemocratic practice is also being transferred to the level of member states. Even our President Gitanas Nausėda is being attacked, and his election challenged, although he received 67% of the votes. This is not conducive to democracy. Europe is becoming an ideological void due to the EPP and Socialist arrangement. It is in disarray. Therefore, in the name of true European solidarity, a third or fourth force is needed that will be able to heal Europe, to restore its true face based on its roots. It is precisely the ECR that is the force that recognises this and wants to change it, as we discussed recently at summits in Warsaw and Madrid. We also spoke about the need to strengthen Europe's energy independence and the development of its own industry, including heavy and defence industries. In accordance with this idea, today we would not be facing problems with our defence capabilities in an era of aggression in Europe. Ladies and Gentlemen! Europe and the Union need more democracy and freedom based on Christian values, the traditional family, and free thought, because such is the true soul of Europe.\n",

      "\tMadam President, President Nausėda of Lithuania, first of all I am more than happy to be here as from one from the Baltic States, from Estonia. And I really appreciate your several statements that Latvia and Lithuania have been together in history and the good and also in the bad times If we just remind the history, it was pretty easy for Russia — they called it the Soviet Union at the time but it was Russia, the same thing — to break down each country one by one because all those three countries, Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania, had their own some kind of policy. And for Moscow, it wasn’t very hard to have some kind of deals each by each. And the result we know pretty well and it’s just experience for the history. If you try to make some kind of deals with Satan, you are the loser from the beginning, there is no chance. To remind some of the necessity of the support to Ukraine. We all agree, most of us agree here. And there is different kind of ways to help Ukraine. But the most necessary definitely is military aid. As we can see in the news, the next weeks and the next months will be very crucial in Ukraine because both sides haven’t won. And if somebody’s saying that there is no winner in the war, there is. The winner can be only Ukraine, because if they lose we will be the next ones. And there is no question about that. As I looked just on the statistics, the resources, those three Baltic states have given the biggest military and financial aid to Ukraine. Estonia with 1%, Latvia with 0.98%, Lithuania with 0.65% of the GDP. And the fourth one is Poland with 0.63%. At the same time, there has been very huge help from the US and from the UK. But they can do more. And the problem for us now is that we really don’t have a lot yet to really give to Ukraine. But there are much more to give from the US, from the UK, also from Germany and France. Germany has given 0.17% of the GDP, France 0.07% of the GDP. Those are just cold facts and numbers. And now the question is: are they really brave enough to make this change in the war or not? Because if we will lose this momentum now, in the next month, we will face the new war in the next two or three years. So just a moment to think which kind of chances we have if somebody is talking about the peace negotiations. The peace can be only if the conditions are good for us. And the only conditions that are good for us can be that there is no ambitions for Russia to start any kind of aggression in next decades. I will not say ‘forever’. We shouldn’t be very naive. Russia will not disappear. But the only thing what we can do is just to weaken them as much as possible and to show that they cannot win their neighbours. And finally, I would like to really thank you that Lithuania was one of the countries two years ago who showed how to deal with illegal migration. There is no question that if you are the war refugee, you need help. There is no doubt. But what we saw in Belarus, it was just illegal migration, what was used by Belarus for the hybrid attacks. And Lithuania, together with Poland, just shut down the border and said ‘there is no way to enter to the European countries through those countries illegally’, because if you open the border, there would be no ending, no ending at all. And you did absolutely well. So labai ačiū, thank you so much. And good luck for the Baltic cooperation.\n",

      "\tMadam President, President Nausėda, President of Lithuania, I welcome you to the European Parliament. All political groups, from the very first moment, expressed our clear, absolute condemnation of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, and your presence here is an opportunity to discuss the future of the European Union: What must we do to stop the European Union from ageing, from its geopolitical and economic role on the planet from weakening, and to move more effectively to address the demands and concerns of citizens. To achieve these goals, we need a European Union that is not just a common market and \"a bit of a political union\". We need a stronger Community budget, larger than 1% of European GDP, with more own resources, with more money for reducing social inequalities, which have increased, to support the poorest countries and the poorest social categories, to implement the Green Deal; a European Union that must remain a project of peace and democracy. Because democracy is suffering even within the European Union: in Poland and in Hungary, unfortunately also in my homeland Greece, and I do not think, Mr President, that you yourself are satisfied that democracy is at its best in Lithuania either. Therefore, we must respect the rule of law and avoid the risk of paralysis in the Council, where unanimity often becomes a weapon in the hands of blackmailers, of governments that block the functioning of the European Union to extort, to achieve something for their own interests. Regarding enlargement, let us be honest. Let us not promise the peoples of Moldova, Georgia, and Ukraine things that require years and changes and conditions. Beware! Enlargement towards the Western Balkans was decided at the Thessaloniki Summit, in my homeland, in 2003, and 20 years later, the countries of the Western Balkans are waiting for the European Union to fulfil its commitments, and of course, they too must carry out the necessary reforms.

They were occupied and they remained independent. I remember that, in 1987, our Prime Minister, from our party, Cavaco Silva – who was Prime Minister ten years and President of the Republic ten years – had a huge conflict with the Parliament because he didn’t agree with a visit to the Soviet Union, where the territories of Baltic states were included. And the government fell down because he was defending this principle. So, I have to tell you that, for decades, we were in the European Union defending the sovereignty and the future of democracy and freedom to Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia. And today, Mr President, we are very proud because your country became a world front runner of defence, of democracy, of freedom, of human rights. This was clear when you sent all the support to the Ukrainian people, but also when you are claiming for democracy in Belarus and when you are saying that you don’t accept the blackmail of China. The example of the Ukrainian solidarity shows that you want for other countries in Europe, and I dare say in world, the same fate that Lithuania had, which was in a very, very oppressive regime and managed to become independent and to give freedom, prosperity and human rights’ respect to all the citizens. I would like to thank you, to say ačiū, Mr President, to all the Lithuanian people and also to you and to your government.

It takes courage never to turn your back on your allies. Your country has shown this courage; your people embody it.

Faced with the illegal and unjustified aggression against Ukraine, we are acting as Europeans: sanctions, macro-financial assistance, provision of weapons. Faced with the energy crisis, we continue to act as Europeans: creation of new supply lines, reinvestment in new green energies, creation of a social climate fund.

Let us continue to act as sovereign and solidary Europeans.

In Parliament, we are ready for this. It is up to us to follow this path. The path your people are charting so that these actions do not go unanswered and that we collectively live up to the concerns and aspirations of all Europeans.

There is concern regarding the income of the country's farmers, the management of the milk crisis, and the potential consequences of this crisis for the future of Lithuanian agriculture. I am concerned that the country's regional policy has still not met expectations, as the income gap between those living in the country's regions and the capital is still quite significant.

Croatia defended itself, liberated itself, and today knows very well what Ukraine is going through: years of prepared aggression, strong propaganda attacks, but also the orchestration and support of internal rebellion. This is what Ukraine is experiencing today, this is what Croatia survived, and essentially, all of this was prepared, perhaps in different forms, for the Baltic states as well. In the past decade, the Baltic states have felt disinformation attacks, as well as attacks on their digital infrastructure. Ukraine also suffers most from attacks on civilian infrastructure today.

We have seen enormous excess profits in the energy sector, and in some parts of the pharmaceutical and banking sectors. I believe that common efforts are needed to curb these excess profits and for the funds to be allocated to the most necessary defence and the creation of a welfare state.

The independent press was closed, politicians, government officials and at least 11 journalists were imprisoned without trial, among them Dawit Isaak. The crimes against human rights in Eritrea do not stop despite all the pressure from the outside world. The commitment to Dawit's release is strong in Sweden. According to a report in Dagens Nyheter in 2010, Dawit lived as prisoner no. 36 in a desolate prison, chained underground. The cells are said to be damp, overcrowded and unhealthy. The prisoners have poor access to water and are starving, but the most important thing in the article can still be said to be that it was confirmed from credible sources that Dawit Isaak was still alive at the time. In the same year, a representative of the Eritrean regime stated that Dawit Isaak cannot ever face trial, as he and other prisoners are alleged by the regime to pose a threat to the existence of the nation of Eritrea. Dawit's family lives in total uncertainty, and so do the rest of us. That is why this resolution is so important today.\n",

We are seeing an increase in violence directed against journalists and democracy and human-rights activists across the world. Sixteen years have passed – that is how long Dawit Isaak and other journalists and democracy activists have been imprisoned in Eritrea. Dawit has become a symbol for the struggle for human rights and press freedom. But for many people he is more than a symbol. Back home in Sweden, where he has his loved ones, he is dearly missed, as are the other imprisoned journalists. Sixteen years have passed, and this is our message to the Eritrean Government: at least let us hear from him! Our message to the Commission is: hear us! This Parliament has repeatedly stated that no development cooperation can be pursued with the Eritrean Government as long as they do not respect human rights and set Dawit Isaak and others free. Yet major aid to Eritrea under the European Development Fund has been resumed and a EUR 200 million National Indicative Programme has been signed off. Our resolution denounces this renewal of business as usual. This money cannot go to the Eritrean Government. It must be used to promote democracy and human rights, in the hands of civil society, with not a single cent to the regime. We will not forget about Dawit Isaak and others.

When documents are falsified, they undermine internal security in the Schengen area, which is an area of free movement without border controls. This new law addresses this problem by ensuring enhanced cooperation between European Union Member States and partner countries, to take steps regarding the authenticity or falsity of documents. This will guarantee greater security at the external borders and the security of the citizens we represent. We know that the only way we can enjoy the benefits that the Schengen area brings is for our citizens to have confidence in the management of the external borders. And this law is instrumental and essential in all of this – borders, security, and the fight against crime. The new law will help to identify and intercept falsified documents. This law provides a framework for this to happen without delay and with the assistance of Frontex, which will also be responsible for sharing information with all participating countries, assisting and informing them on how to detect situations involving document falsification. The law clarifies Frontex's role in establishing FADO. We have strengthened what falls under this law so that FADO includes more information than it does today. We want uniformity and consistency in the level of information that FADO holds regarding the genuineness, falsity, and fraudulent nature of documents, and for the information to be centralised. We also wanted Frontex to have the necessary flexibility to establish and improve FADO. We ensured that the Agency drafts a new document on effective measures for identifying falsification methods. Naturally, we did everything we could to ensure personal data is compliant with European laws. The result should lead to greater protection while simultaneously guaranteeing stricter security. FADO is essential in the fight against falsification, particularly at the external borders. The participation of countries that are not European Union partners but participate in the Schengen area is also crucial, as ultimately this will have a positive impact on the security of the external borders. This might seem like an overly technical system, but it is a system which I believe we agree is essential to complement the reform of European borders and the protection of these borders. In these negotiations, we did our utmost to broaden the responsibilities falling under this Regulation. This was done while detailing the specific responsibilities of the Agency and ensuring that the processing of personal data by the Agency and the Member States complies with European laws. We also ensured that the Parliament has a greater role in FADO.

The use of fraudulent documents by foreign citizens seeking a better life in Europe is common, and the cost of such a document can reach up to 5-6 thousand euros. Document fraud is one of the main enablers for terrorism and organised crime and is linked to the smuggling of drugs, weapons, and stolen vehicles, as well as human trafficking and, especially in recent years, migrant smuggling. Not infrequently, the obtaining of authentic travel documents is based on fraudulent identity documents. This is precisely what makes their detection so difficult. In this regard, it is crucial to enhance the security of travel documents issued in the European Union, including the related identity management infrastructure. On the other hand, cooperation between different authorities must go beyond law enforcement activities, as it requires establishing links with document-issuing authorities, as well as with international organisations, airlines, shipping companies, and others. In view of all this, I call on you to support the proposal for integrating the online system for fraudulent and authentic documents into the European Border and Coast Guard, as a final step towards completing its reform.\n",

Yes, inasmuch as it can lead to criminality, money laundering from illicit business, or even terrorism. Does the European Parliament have something to say? The answer is yes; we are saying it. We are ready to support an instrument that ensures the storage, exchange, and verification of false documents, to combat fraud, and we are willing to trust the European Border and Coast Guard Agency, which we strengthened with the Regulation we adopted in 2019, to be responsible for securely sharing this information with the Member States, with the European Union, with international relations and, ultimately, with all entities that may be relevant for verifying the true identity of individuals enjoying free movement in the Schengen area. Our demand is always that this be compatible with the work we have done to ensure data confidentiality, fundamental rights. Ultimately, the foundational values of the European Union.

      "\tMr President, let me start by thanking the rapporteur, Ms Metsola, for her work. As a new Member of this House working on my first legislative file, I very much appreciated her lead. Now on substance. Verifying the authenticity of travel documents has been turning for quite some time into a pressure point in the work of border guards, because of time constraints, the tremendous increase in the number of travellers in Europe, and the diversity of travel documents that are being used. Furthermore, the sophistication of forgery techniques has been a constant challenge for our law enforcement officials. The new FADO system has already been in use for some time, serving these needs. What we are now doing, and this is very important, is to bring it from the intergovernmental into the Community method by adding it to the list of instruments entrusted to the EBCGA (European Border and Coast Guard Agency) as part of the enlarged mandates that we decided to give last year. This means increased accountability towards, and scrutiny by, this House, and higher safeguards in the regime applicable to the data contained therein and the measurement of access rights. The protection of personal data was one of the main issues that we had to deal with during the negotiations of this file, and we made sure that the processing of personal data is limited to what is strictly necessary for the purpose of detecting or investigating document fraud. We also introduced clear rules on accessing the database, with Member States now having an express obligation to determine which authorities competent in the area of document fraud are to have access to the FADO system and their level of access, and then to notify the Commission and the Agency. The Commission, upon request, will now have to transmit this information to this House. The negotiated text complements the reform of the EBCGA and will ensure better protection of the Union’s external borders and more efficient law enforcement. I therefore encourage my fellow MEPs to support this text.\n",

In recent years, we have witnessed a significant increase in document fraud in the Schengen area, perpetrated both through the falsification of genuine documents and the use of forged documents. This measure will allow us to integrate the management of the online system for false and authentic documents, known as FADO, within Frontex, whose management model is now obsolete. The need for defence and security that our citizens demand of us compels us to ensure a very high level of alert against false documents, as they are criminal tools suitable for reuse in various crimes, including money laundering and terrorism, but above all, illegal immigration. Indeed, forged documents have often been used by asylum seekers attempting to enter Europe. These are behaviours that we cannot tolerate and that must be stopped. It therefore becomes essential to provide the police, border guards, and customs with a more efficient database, capable of allowing for the rapid identification of falsified documents and effective combatting of these phenomena. For these reasons, we support the proposal, despite our stated disagreement with some private entities accessing FADO, even if with limitations. Although we are against the reform of the Frontex agency's regulation, we consider the importance of using FADO today to be paramount in the fraud combatting activities carried out by Member State authorities.\n",

We will obviously be vigilant to ensure that this does not portend a strengthening of the agency's mandate – FADO is not a tool to combat migration, but rather an instrument to combat false documents in general. The overall compromise is balanced, particularly through the establishment of safeguards allowing third parties, namely airlines from third countries, to access the database, albeit with limited access.

Numerous investigations conducted by Europol have repeatedly shown that forged documents are often the means used by criminal organisations to commit other much more serious crimes, such as human trafficking, migrant smuggling, or even for the preparation of terrorist attacks. To prevent the commission of such crimes, therefore, among other measures, stricter control at external borders is necessary. We therefore welcome the fact that the regulation transfers the competence relating to the system for managing forged and authentic documents to FADO, from the Council to Frontex, thus finally completing the legislative reform of this agency, a reform which, however, must be followed by proper and complete implementation to truly make the rules approved so far effective.

Looking at progress in this area, we have made progress, but despite that, the number of children dying or suffering from undernutrition remains unacceptably high. This oral question and resolution seeks to ensure this issue is given the priority it deserves by the Commission in our collective action towards the post-2015 global development framework. Undernutrition represents an enormous development challenge. The World Health Organisation says that undernutrition is the biggest contributor to child mortality, causing 35% of the disease burden in children under five. It can create a vicious cycle of poverty, can reduce productivity and impede social and economic development. That is why the fight against child undernutrition and the provision of universal access to adequate nutritious food should remain as one of the major goals in the post-2015 agenda. We voted on Tuesday on that issue, and it is something we do feel is very important. In the draft document by the Own Working Group of the United Nations, goal 2 of the draft SDGs has a target to end all forms of malnutrition by 2030 and by 2025 achieve the internationally-agreed targets on stunting and wasting in children under five. The World Health Organisation Assembly endorses the global target for a 40% reduction of the global number of children under five who are stunted by 2025. That means reducing the number of stunted children by more than 70 million – 70 million, colleagues – by 2025. In the Stier report on Tuesday, our Parliament voted with a huge majority to support this objective and goes further, calling for the zero hunger goal to end the scandal of hunger by 2025. It calls for promoting sustainable agriculture and recognising the specific needs of women farmers related to food security. These are vital efforts in our fight against child malnutrition. So what we are asking the Commission for this morning, and why we have asked for this debate, is because we now need a concrete action plan from the Commission on how we, as the European Union, can contribute to the child undernutrition targets, and how we can work with our international partners to achieve this. I understand that the Commission services have been working on an action plan on nutrition, and I wonder, Commissioner, could you update us on this and tell us what is happening and when we can expect something concrete? And how can the Commission ensure coordination, both in its different policies and with our international partners, in speeding up progress towards the WHO targets? Reduced and ending child undernutrition is possible but, like our other development policies, it requires resources, coordination and political will. This week we have had a debate marking the 25th anniversary of the Convention on the Rights of the Child. Tackling undernutrition in the next 15 to 20 years would be a key contribution to make sure that every child could have the basic right that gives them the opportunity for a decent life.\n",

      "\tFirst of all, I want to thank the chairman of the Committee for Development Policy, Ms. Linda McAvan, for taking on the role of rapporteur for the document that the committee actually approved already in the last election period. I also thank my colleagues who were in charge of this topic in individual political groups for their cooperation in submitting amendments. It was already mentioned here that this week we voted on the document, what will happen after 2015 with the Millennium Goals. Malnutrition is a truly complex problem that burdens the entire society. It lies as a burden, because basic human rights are not respected when there is insufficient nutrition, and that is the right to a dignified life of the smallest, those children who live in hunger. When we consider that several children die every minute, not because there is a war in their countries and not because they are sick, but because they are hungry. And it's not just those children who die, it's other children, thousands and thousands of children, who suffer lifelong consequences from this lack of nutrition. We are talking about numbers here - I think we already know those numbers almost by heart, but cooperation is important, cooperation is important both with the institutions of the European Union, but also with other organizations that deal with nutrition, especially with the FAO. There should be a meeting this week, and I think that cooperation should be closer. And just one more sentence: I believe that what the commissioner said at the hearing, that we will look more at poverty, we will look more at hunger than at climate change.\n",

      "\tMr President, ladies and gentlemen, dear Commissioner, I welcome you and I would like to tell you that our first meeting in this Chamber is taking place on a particularly significant topic, because there are such dramatic realities to which we almost end up becoming accustomed, as if they were inevitable. But then, looking at them a little more closely, we realize that they are not at all inevitable or inexorable, that they are tragic but perfectly solvable realities. We know how it should be done, we know what tools should be put in place, we know the causes of these phenomena and we see their effects. And therefore I think that the very fact – as my colleague also said – that they are not inevitable should really make us take on a great responsibility and understand that if it is possible to do it, we must do it. The problem is whether we are able, whether we want to deploy the tools and above all do it adequately. Today this phenomenon of malnutrition, of child malnutrition, takes on even more subtle, more hidden forms: it is the so-called hidden hunger, which is less evident, less impactful even as images that reach our eyes, to knowledge through NGOs and health workers. international cooperation, but which are equally negative and detrimental to the development of boys and girls. And therefore this phenomenon of hidden hunger is also among those that we want to address. We are mobilizing these days with renewed vigor precisely to coincide with the 25th anniversary of the Declaration of the Rights of the Child. And I really thank our president Linda McAvan and all my colleagues and shadow colleagues because around the re-proposal of this resolution we want to tell you that our commitment as Parliament is there, not only of the DEVE commission, but of the entire Parliament. We ask the Commission to take this step forward with equal effectiveness, with equal conviction. I really think that we should not have - I say this first of all to myself - the right to commemorate and celebrate if we do not accompany this right with a serious commitment, a measurable commitment (you spoke of numbers, figures and dates, and we appreciated it) and a commitment that also looks at effectiveness in its use. We know that the resources allocated to international development, like other resources within the Union, are not always used effectively, but here we cannot afford to lose anything. So this dimension of monitoring effectiveness, of understanding what happens to our plans, also becomes absolutely essential. So I believe we must make these commitments with renewed vigor. You spoke about these plans, you also spoke about the need to carry out an evaluation of the effectiveness to see how to reprogram the interventions. Here, I ask you to maintain a very collaborative and very engaging relationship with Parliament throughout this process because you will find, as you have seen, in the commission great skills and great passion and therefore a great desire to collaborate in developing the most effective measures . Many things have been done – Linda McAvan cited some results, she cited them – and I think that Europe should be proud of having contributed to these results. However, the phenomenon is returning in certain geographical areas and places where it did not exist due to the economic crisis, due to speculation on the prices of food, of essential food products. Therefore we also ask you to involve your colleagues for a vision of a slightly more horizontal and all-round policy to trace the causes of some of these phenomena which can be tackled perhaps in other sectors, with a different agricultural policy, for example, with a different commercial policy, with a financial policy. This phenomenon of commodity speculation on food is something – I believe – intolerable for the common opinion of this Parliament. Finally, a final observation: we have all seen, by reading and documenting ourselves, not only for this occasion but for our work, how the role of women is fundamental. There are data that make you shudder: women contribute 80% of food production in developing countries and are 60% of the malnourished; they contribute to producing and being the real farmers, and have 2% of the ownership. Here we also make politics towards women, who are an element of development in many countries, not only in the West we know.\n",

Just the day before yesterday, in this room, Pope Francis said: \"We cannot accept that millions of people around the world are dying of hunger, while every day tons of food are thrown away from our tables.\" According to research conducted by the United Nations, 1.3 million tons of food are destroyed every year. Ladies and Gentlemen! No actions by the Commission, no subsidies spent on combating the problem of malnutrition will bring results if we do not first comprehensively change legal regulations and practices of food producers. Why do we need to debate this general document if, in accordance with EU law, it will still be possible to speculate on the prices of products by throwing away tons of food products in order to prevent their prices from falling. And punish those who share their food surpluses with taxes. In this context, the Commission's proposals to tackle child hunger by promoting gender equality and empowering women in all areas related to nutrition seem like a grim joke. We must have the courage to tell ourselves the brutal truth here in this room. It is EU legislation that largely allows for unethical practices by food producers. If we want to counteract the greatest shame of today - the scourge of hunger among children - we must take really decisive action and start by changing the regulations that have so far thwarted many of our efforts to improve the lives of the weakest among us. Mr Commissioner! Please provide specific actions you plan to change legal regulations that would solve this problem.\n",

      "\tMr President, Commissioner, the world is experiencing a silent crisis which is devastating entire communities in the developing world. Examining this issue in the European Parliament therefore requires us to focus on a humanitarian, political, economic and developmental scourge which requires a coordinated and coherent response. This is obviously an ethical imperative which also generates collateral economic effects. We all know – it has been said and repeated here – that more than 165 million children under the age of five are undernourished and that the first thousand days of life are of capital importance for the development of child. We all know the nutritional crises that recurrently strike the Sahel and sub-Saharan Africa. What interests me is how we are going to tackle the causes of this evil? We cannot dissociate this question from that of food self-sufficiency. I would like – I have great confidence in you, I had the opportunity to attend your performance at the time of your audition, so I think that you are certainly aware of these questions – that, in Your plan and your approach must first take into account the need for cross-cutting policies that are not focused only on undernutrition but also on the issue of food self-sufficiency. I have yet to hear about the topic of land grabbing; I see that in Africa, there is a real tendency in the economic world to grab land, a tendency with obviously dramatic consequences. There was talk of water, there is also education and technical transfer, perhaps from us, which can improve the productivity and yield of these lands. I agree with the speaker who highlights the fact that it is quite scandalous to allow financial speculation on food. As for the question of women, I obviously agree because I am a privileged witness to the major role of women, particularly in Africa and in the economic world. Mr Commissioner, we trust you and we expect you to come back to us with a fairly broad plan which covers the entire issue.\n",

In my country, in Galicia, there are more than 20% of children below the poverty level. In the Spanish State, today, 60% more people are at risk of poverty and social exclusion than in 2007. The cause of this situation lies in the policies of the European Union, which make it possible for multinationals to steal people's wealth, which prevent them from developing their agriculture, which occupy their lands, which impose free trade agreements that are ruinous for people. Without questioning these policies there will be no solution to hunger and malnutrition in the south, without putting an end to the troika's policies, hunger and malnutrition in the north will continue to spread. Sr. Commissioner, we must radically change the European Union's neoliberal policies, with urgent measures such as putting an end to the rapacious policies of multinationals, putting an end to free trade agreements, acting, adapting and changing agricultural and food policies within the framework of food sovereignty. Anything other than moving forward with measures of this type will be empty words, and next year we will continue here to count numbers of malnourished people, numbers of people dying of hunger.\n",

      "\tToday we are voting on an important report. Because it is shameful that millions of children still have to suffer from hunger and that every few minutes a child dies of hunger. I am also very pleased - a big thank you to Mrs McAvan - that in this report we are not just talking about malnutrition, but also about malnutrition, because it is not enough for children to get enough calories. For healthy growth and age-appropriate development, they need a balanced diet with vitamins and trace elements, to name just a few. However, we will not achieve this if we continue to promote the usual monocultures. They displace diversified cultivation systems with different types of grain and vegetables and thus also the production of the required micronutrients. I here call on the EU to follow the recommendations of the EU Special Rapporteur on the right to food, who explicitly identifies more organic agriculture as a way for these countries to feed themselves, and who also refers to the role of agriculture in climate change and poverty alleviation. It is therefore important to promote and support small farmers because they have the potential to spread diverse climate-friendly farming systems, they have the potential to produce fair food that corresponds to local dietary habits, they have the potential to create an economy to build. Because primary production is also linked to processing, transport and trade in the region. This is where the potential for workers lies and therefore the first step out of poverty. But without land, food cannot be grown. This means that traditional land rights must be protected and access to land must be ensured for the local population, especially women. The winner here cannot be the one who puts more money on the table. The local population must be the winner here, and we must under no circumstances encourage further land grabbing. Investments in agriculture are absolutely necessary. They are necessary if we want to combat hunger and poverty in developing countries. But not every type of investment in agriculture is helpful here. If private investors end up driving the local population more or less away from their own resources and depriving them of them in order to carry out this essential food production themselves, in order to produce large margins for the world market, for international markets, then no child will be fed up. Trade agreements must also take this into account in the future, they must also do justice to this. Otherwise, these countries will become more and more dependent on the international raw material markets and on the fluctuations in prices on these markets. They become dependent on food speculation, and stock market developments therefore become decisive in determining whether a child can go to bed hungry or full at the end of the day. This is extremely immoral and we have to fight against it. Poverty and hunger can be prevented by providing sufficient support to local farmers. This is the only way for these countries to achieve food sovereignty. We need further greening of farming systems to adapt them to climate change, because it is precisely these countries that will be the first to be affected by climate change. Both are basic elements in the fight against poverty and hunger.\n",

Unlike democratic Ethiopia, the Egyptian military ruler in the neighbouring country is causing problems by trying to enforce an old colonial right over the Nile. I think this is not sustainable; I think that Ethiopia, which contributes over 80% of the waters of the Nile, should have access to the Nile, not just for generating electricity but also for agriculture, and for feeding and providing water for its citizens.

Of these, 225 million children are under the age of 5 and are chronically malnourished. Technological progress has made it possible, among other things, to have food for everyone, but despite this, children still die of hunger and are still malnourished. It is a scandal, as Pope Francis called it, whose messages I hope we have not only listened to and quickly forgotten, but have accepted and supported with our long applause in this House. So there is food for all, but no justice for all. That's why this week we passed the Resolution on a new global framework for development and we asked the European Union and the international community to focus on the causes of poverty and hunger. And in this Resolution of colleague McAvan, it is clearly mentioned what those causes are, and there are more of them. But, in short, if we are going to reason following the Pope's messages, then we have to conclude that the main causes of poverty and hunger are actually selfish human behaviors and policies that have only material interests at their center, and those of the strongest, and ignore the dignity of human life in its entire duration. Yes, as a Christian Democrat I will emphasize that the issue of child malnutrition shows that the dignity of human life must be protected from the very beginning. As stated in paragraph 3 of this Resolution, the first 1000 days of a child's life are the most important, including the period of pregnancy. However, it is not enough to say that we want to protect life from the beginning, it is also necessary, through an effective coherent development policy, to enable that child when he is born to have quality nutrition, access to health care, education, and we all have to work much harder on this together. In this regard, I welcome the Commission's intention to invest EUR 3.5 billion, as well as the intention of the commissioner who said that he wants strict monitoring for the implementation and evaluation of the effectiveness of these programs. And I also expect that the Council in December will support the goal of this Parliament for the complete eradication of hunger, the so-called Zero Hunger Goal.\n",

We can feed 10 billion people with the current arable area, provided we stop spending most of our grains and crops on animal feed, on biofuel. 70% of arable land is used to feed animals instead of people. To achieve this, Brussels' agricultural policy must be drastically reformed and we must stop providing our own farmers with 363 billion euros in agricultural subsidies, we must stop dumping agricultural surpluses in developing countries. However, the best measure is simple and cheap: our consumption pattern. We need to eat less meat! Every five seconds a child dies of hunger.

We really know that the mental development of a child under the age of 5 is also hindered if he does not get enough important micronutrients with food. UNICEF, for example, has taken this issue very seriously and taken action on it. Indeed, as the commissioner says, the EU can also act through UN organizations to promote this issue. It is largely a question of the fact that there has also been a shift to more one-sided farming. Because of this, the Greens have presented an amendment that emphasizes the importance of an agroecological approach. That has also been the message of the UN special rapporteur. Namely, it gives opportunities for more versatile farming, which in turn means that specifically mothers who are farmers in Africa can offer more versatile nutrition to children, which is absolutely necessary for their development. I would also like to draw attention to an issue that my colleague Michel also addressed, i.e. land grabbing. We should be able to study how the European Union's free trade agreements with developing countries actually affect the fact that large companies are increasingly taking over large farming areas from the governments of developing countries, which in turn reduce the opportunities for small farmers. We would like an investigation into this.

Great progress has been made towards achieving one of the Millennium Development Goals, namely halving the rate of undernourished people in developing countries. However, the problem has not disappeared, it is ubiquitous and complicated. I therefore support the content of the draft resolution. The leading cause of malnutrition among children in all regions of the world is poverty. The most difficult situation is in South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa. According to UNICEF data, approximately 100 million children worldwide suffer from malnutrition, and over 50 million children under the age of five suffer from hunger. However, as many as 160 million children around the world suffer from short stature. Malnutrition hinders a child's physical development, weakens his or her intellect, ability to concentrate and learn, and consequently deprives him or her of the chance to be independent in the future, find a good job and break the cycle of poverty in which he or she grows up. Therefore, in the report on the global development framework after 2015, which was passed yesterday by a large majority, MEP Davor Stier mentioned combating poverty and, therefore, hunger and malnutrition among children as the most important goal. As a member of the DEVE committee, I would like to emphasize the particular need to help developing countries by supporting their actual development, which will enable them to be self-sufficient in the future. We cannot refuse emergency help, especially in extreme cases where not only children but their entire families suffer from hunger. Malnutrition is particularly dangerous for pregnant women because it can cause significant damage or impede the development of the fetus. Well-nourished children are hope for future generations, they are healthier and learn better. Thanks to this, they have a chance to provide themselves and others with decent living conditions in the future. Meanwhile, in the world today, every 5/6 seconds - as we already know - one child dies. Together we can change this.\n",

Two billion people in the world suffer from hidden hunger; millions of children suffer from extreme hunger leading to death.

Education gives an important job and economic growth potential to fight hunger and poverty, to have a sustainable development and an improvement in the social situation. Learning about food and nutrition should be an integral part of formal education, so that we grow a healthy generation capable of living in a dignified way. An investment in this sense is an investment in the future; investment in people who are able to find work to survive themselves and support their families.

Thus, before the age of five, little girls are three times more likely than little boys to suffer from severe malnutrition. Deprived of good nutritional conditions and therefore even more vulnerable to growth problems, girls are more likely to die when they are still very young. It is therefore appropriate to identify cultural and religious obstacles in discriminatory practices and attitudes harmful to girls, and obviously try to remedy them. Furthermore, according to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations, if women farmers had access to the same means of production as men, they could increase yields worldwide by 20 to 30% and increase the agricultural production for food purposes. In other words, these advances would prevent 100 million people, or even 150 million, from going hungry. Consequently, fighting against inequalities between men and women and between girls and boys from a very young age, putting an end to the unfavorable treatment of little girls, improving the prospects of women farmers, these are concrete areas for fighting against malnutrition of children in developing countries.

From our side, the Commission and the Member States should mobilize long-term financial resources and investments in the field of nutrition and cooperate effectively with international organizations. Financial aid, investment and financial resources are extremely important in the fight against the threat of acute malnutrition in developing countries. However, in many cases – Mali or Syria as examples – stopping conflict, preventing violence and creating political stability through diplomatic and political negotiations is certainly as important as foreign financial aid.\n",

      "\tMr President, ladies and gentlemen, child malnutrition and world hunger must be the real priority for the European Union and the Commission must develop serious policies against food waste. For too many children, childhood is not a joyful phase: over 225 million children under the age of 5 suffer from malnutrition or growth delays as a result. In developing countries, it causes the death of 2.6 million children every year and is by far the leading cause of infant mortality. The European Union is therefore called upon to significantly intensify its efforts on this issue. The complexity of the approaches would require a higher control room with the involvement of multiple strategic sectors (health, education, agriculture and water resources) through integrated actions with which to combat and definitively eradicate the drama. For this task to which the European Union is called, it must press, involving the United Nations, G8, G20 and emerging countries, the governments of countries at risk of a nutritional emergency to promote reforms that place less selfish pressure on the large agri-food production chains as well as small farmers more effectively able to sustainably produce sufficient food for themselves and their families.\n",

However, the food and financial crises since 2008 have once again caused these figures to increase and endanger the achievement of the Millennium Development Goals. Therefore, although the 3.5 billion euros announced by the Commission to combat this situation are positive, a greater effort is needed. To do this, it is necessary to review the actions we have undertaken and frame them within a plan that includes the main axes that Unicef itself has set as a roadmap. In this multisectoral plan I would dare to highlight three major objectives: the first objective, a program for the child's first thousand days, considered critical for their subsequent development; the second, the promotion of small-scale agriculture; and, thirdly and no less important, stimulate and encourage the participation of women in the distribution of resources, because it is clear and recognized that, when women distribute resources within the family and control them, malnutrition within the family it is much lower.

      "\tMr. President, with 3.1 million child deaths each year in developing countries, malnutrition is the largest factor in mortality in children under five years of age. The fight against child malnutrition is and remains one of the main Millennium Development Goals for 2015. When we talk about child malnutrition, we always link it to food insecurity and poverty, but also to unhealthy home environments and inadequate access to health services. Currently 805 million people in the world do not have enough food to lead a healthy life, most of them in Sub-Saharan Africa and also in Asia. One in nine people in the world is in this situation. In the world there are also 66 million school-age children who go to school hungry. The first thousand days of a child's life are fundamental—it has been said here—so that they can have full growth and their dignity can be respected. It is the period that is considered, therefore, most critical to prevent malnutrition and its consequences in adulthood. It is true that the European Union has made an important effort in all development cooperation issues, but we still must do more to be able to alleviate this problem, with innovative financing, but also with long-term financing. What is intended is that we can talk about the availability of food, the accessibility of these foods and also that these foods can be adapted to the needs of the children themselves. We must invest more in health, in education, but also in equal opportunities. A large part of women and children who work in agriculture, if they had the same rights and if they had the same opportunities and the same access to services as men, would not be in this situation. Therefore, I would like to encourage the Commission and the Commissioner to work along these lines. Above all, political will is needed to invest in these areas.\n",

Therefore, I would like to bring to this debate the expression child hunger within the European Union. Particularly in the countries intervened by the Troika, it is urgent to talk about the hunger created by unemployment, bankruptcies and an absent State. In my country, Portugal, it is the schools that guarantee children a hot meal. These are the same schools that open their doors on Saturdays and Sundays to ensure that children do not go without food. And do you know why? Because in a country of unemployment, where migration is forced, parents cannot feed and support their children. In 2011 – we are talking about the middle of the crisis – around 29% of Portuguese children were at risk of poverty. With the poverty imposed by austerity, it is estimated that 35 thousand children are hungry in my country. There is hunger in Europe, there is hunger in Greece, in Spain, in Portugal, in Ireland.

As other colleagues have said, every single day, 22 000 children die of malnutrition, and 90% of those deaths are within Asia and Africa. Every single death is preventable, and I think we need to ensure that the political will is in place to resolve this issue once and for all. Colleagues have spoken about the need to support farmers in the developing world, to make sure that they have the right equipment, the right technology, to make sure they have support. We have also spoken about the need to improve diet, to make sure that there is a sustainable food supply. We have also spoken about the need to ensure that discrimination, especially discrimination against women, is tackled within the developing world, and the position of women in terms of education at home and in the workplace also needs to be tackled. We also have to encourage greater use of breastfeeding to avoid contaminated water; and I think, crucially, a plan needs to be built around a child’s first 1 000 days, which other people have spoken about. The first two years are crucial in terms of getting on top of the problem of malnutrition. I think tackling food price volatility and food price security is another issue that we need to address. Even though progress has been made, much more can be done, and if we resolve to do this together, working with other partners throughout the world, I believe that we can address this even further.

Regulation should be based on a clear analysis of the health, environmental and social consequences of the proposed regulation. The Commission did not present these effects, nor the consequences for European agriculture. The deficit of non-GMO protein feed in EU livestock farming is huge. Before us, we do not have the social effects of the possible collapse of farms in the EU, nor the assessment of the food market, which would certainly become more expensive if the proposed regulation were adopted so quickly. In the European agricultural model, such a turnaround requires a clear plan, CAP measures must be prepared and there must be enough time for the transformation of agriculture. Food security consists of healthy food and a sufficient amount of food at an affordable price. Due to wrong and hasty decisions - without clear preliminary analysis of the profession - the least that would happen is that many people would not have access to food, because it would become too expensive. A hungry person is also not nutritionally secure. In addition, the implementation of the regulation would be practically impossible, as it would be very difficult to establish a traceability system for food and feed in the first place. The regulation would also not be in line with the EU's free market, as border controls would have to be introduced in case of consistent implementation of its provisions.\n",

In January 2014, Parliament had been very explicit in demanding clear rules starting from its opposition against transgenic corn; the Commission should have interpreted this dissent with coherent and harmonizing proposals and not by handing the matter back to the wild west of multinationals and GMO lobbies. Our position is absolutely against the commercialization of GMOs: also for this reason we are against the TTIP which we consider a Trojan horse of the agri-food multinationals.\n",

By this means we may rely on the results of the processing of petitions and its more intense role in the European Parliament and European lawmaking and revision more substantively. I acknowledge shortcomings in the processing and handling of petitions to date. However, in reinforcing our political commitment in this domain we may revise present deficiencies with regard to the timescale and effective conclusion of petitions, the establishment of a clear mandate, and the potential for the digitalisation of this field. Should said considerations be taken into account and the full potential of the European Citizens’ Initiative be realised, my colleagues and I in the EPP Group would welcome this most enthusiastically.

Other petitioners seek to make their proposals regarding the implementation of EU policies heard and still others approach the European Parliament to challenge decisions taken by national authorities and complain against rulings by national courts. The majority denounce deficiencies in the application of European legislation, whether due to defective transposition of legislation, non-application of community standards, or even violations of them.

I also welcome the part of the report which emphasizes that petitions are an alternative and independent means of investigation and verification of compliance with EU law and that this process is not excluded by proceedings before national courts, which is very important for citizens. The report also recognizes the important role of petitions for the legislative process, as they enable the identification of existing gaps and shortcomings in the transposition of EU legislation, and more can be done here. Because of all the above, I supported the report.\n",

The analysis of the statistical data related to petitions shows that the main reasons for the inadmissibility of petitions are the fact that petitioners still confuse the competences of the EU and the Member States and that they do not distinguish between the EU institutions. The European Commission continues to be the primary partner of the Committee on Petitions in the handling of petitions, as it is responsible for monitoring the application and compliance with EU legislation.

      "\tMr President, President Michel, Vice—President Šefčovič, welcome back to the European Parliament. The decision of the European Council to grant candidate status to Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova and to offer this perspective to Georgia, once it fulfils the conditions, was correct. This is a decision supported by the European Parliament and it corresponds to the expectations of the people in these countries. The people of Ukraine are defending European values with their lives in Ukraine and the people of Moldova have opened their houses to Ukrainian refugees. More Ukrainian refugees have entered the Republic of Moldova in relation to its population than any EU Member State. We, as the European Parliament, have understood early that we can only live in safety and security within the borders of the European Union if the countries in our immediate neighbourhood borders are safe and stable. This is why we called already in March for Ukraine, and in May for the Republic of Moldova, to work towards granting this candidate status. Because in these times we have to act quickly, clearly without hesitation. Dear colleagues, Members of the Parliament, thank you very much for the fact that Parliament stood united since the beginning of this war in supporting countries in our eastern neighbourhood. Ukraine and the Republic of Moldova still have a long way to go before they are ready for EU membership but, Vice-President Šefčovič, we have to make sure that we start this process at a technical level and we have to make sure that even before these countries are ready to join, we support them and we make sure that the people in these countries can start feeling the benefits of getting closer to the European Union. The Council made the right decisions on Ukraine, the Republic of Moldova, but the outcome on Western Balkans was disappointing. I was encouraged, President Michel, by your remarks today, and I believe we all have to work together so that we make sure that the Czech Presidency succeeds where the French Presidency has not managed to succeed, in offering a clear perspective to the Western Balkan countries. Good news came from the European Council when it comes to the euro area. Thank you, President Michel, for endorsing Croatia’s readiness to become a member of the euro area on 1 January. We have yesterday voted with a large majority here to approve Croatia’s entry into the euro area on 1 January. Every single member of the four largest groups in the European Parliament, and many colleagues in the other groups, have voted in favour. So thank you very much dear colleagues, this shows us that Croatia’s path on strengthening its economy, on managing its budget with care, on getting closer to the euro area under the leadership of Prime Minister Andrej Plenković, was correct. It pays off. It is good news for Croatia. It is good news for the euro area. It will make the euro area stronger and it shows the trust in our common currency. Last point, it is our duty, dear colleagues, to further strengthen the European Union. We have to equip the European Union with the tools it needs to overcome the problems that people are facing. We held the Conference on the Future of Europe but, President Michel, the outcome of the European Council saying that ‘we take note of this and we are happy that there was an exchange with citizens’ is too little. We have to take the ideas of the citizens on board. We have to solve their problems and we have to do this together. Council, Commission and Members of the European Parliament, we have to make the EU fit for the future. We have to make sure that it can make decisions, it can react fast, and it offers solutions to the problems that people are facing.\n",

The progress on accession requests is certainly positive. The European Union is the home of democracy. We are the institution to which more and more countries look for stability, security, and peace. The shadows, however, are what we still see concerning energy and economic issues, particularly regarding the security of gas supplies and the fight against inflation – issues that simply must have a European response. The Council's conclusions, although urging the Commission to urgently continue efforts to ensure energy supply at affordable prices, effectively postpone the decision to set a European price cap on gas, which could immediately curb the inflation that is also affecting essential goods. Despite the fear among some that Russia might react to a price cap with retaliations, it should be remembered that Putin is already cutting supplies precisely to prevent Europe from filling its storage facilities and thereby increasing the blackmail against us in the winter months, when we will need gas the most. Therefore, we must act now by diversifying supplies, with massive investments in renewable energy, immediately setting a European price cap on gas, and helping families and businesses caught in the vice-grip of high bills, expensive fuel, and inflation, in a context where we are still not out of the pandemic. Time is running out; we do not need European Councils that postpone decisions, but a united and solidary Union that can provide concrete and effective responses.\n",

While the countries joining, we know, have to undertake tough democratic reforms, the job is not theirs alone. But where the European Council is disappointing a growing number of European citizens, President Michel, is when it comes to the debate on the future of the EU. While Parliament has already called for the establishment of a new Convention, the Council conclusions invite the institutions to follow up on the debates of the citizens only within their competences and within the current Treaties, which basically means the EUCO seems to have ruled out Treaty change and a new Convention. It’s a big disappointment. A big disappointment that the French Presidency did not move forward the process of amending the Treaties, as requested by this House. Furthermore, in the programme we just discussed with the Czech Presidency, we only see a vague reference to continuing the debate.

Never, perhaps, have we been further from it. We will certainly have a universal charger, which is far from useless in everyday life. But what does that represent in light of the increased dependence on the Americans and NATO in matters of defence and foreign policy? For having failed to maintain military means commensurate with the world's challenges and dangers, Europe is forced to place its destiny in the hands of others. This is the very negation of sovereignty and freedom. Instead of striving to consolidate and repair what should be, the European Union continues its headlong rush by making enlargement a dogma, even if it means destabilizing our economic and social models. Hypocrisy regarding ecology and the environment continues unabated, and the French Presidency of the European Union took advantage of its last days to make a nice gift to commercial disorder by signing a new free trade agreement with New Zealand. Finally, despite recurrent posturing, Emmanuel Macron will not have achieved any significant progress in protecting our borders against migratory intrusions from the South and the East.

And the second issue I want to draw attention to, and which has also been mentioned here, concerns the fact that it seems, from our perspective, the most significant issue for Europeans right now – apart from security, apart from the war ongoing in Ukraine – is the energy crisis, which could affect all European families, linked to high energy prices, a lack of energy sources, and high inflation.

Today I want to talk to you about the elephant in the room that everyone wants to forget: the change to the European treaties. Yes, it was indeed on the agenda of the last Council, I checked. But poof! In the discussions, a little magic trick, the subject seemed to have disappeared. Yet, our Parliament had been very clear about its expectations on the matter. The citizens consulted within the framework of the Conference on the Future of Europe had been just as clear: they expect a radical change to the very foundations of the European Union. What about Emmanuel Macron, who paraded around telling anyone who would listen that a change to the treaties was necessary, a proposal he has since buried – certainly since the elections in France passed? The European Heads of State tell us – and I quote the Council conclusions – that they \"take note of the citizens' demands\". That's nice, but since you simultaneously refuse to debate changing the treaties, I have the feeling that you are mostly taking citizens for fools. And if I summarise, we congratulate citizens who want to change the European Union from top to bottom; but on the other hand, we must be serious: everyone must come home, the party's over, not a comma of the European treaties will be touched. We have been warning since the beginning of the Conference on the Future of Europe that yet another parody of democracy would be very poorly received by citizens, who are tired of being disdained. And yet, that is exactly what is happening. Not only is treaty reform put off until the Greek calends, but moreover the EU is more stubborn than ever in its neoliberal business as usual. I'll give an example: last week, bingo! Another new free trade agreement, this time with New Zealand. A brilliant idea, indeed: ecological dumping, imports from the other side of the planet, our farmers in danger. Bravo, keep it up! And why stop there? What if we were to accelerate the return of austerity and the infamous 3% rule in the midst of a crisis? What if we were to insist even more on competition rules to privatise our trains and public services? What if we were to let an independent central bank, without any democratic control, hold the destiny of 450 million citizens in its hands, who will directly pay the consequences of its decisions? I reiterate forcefully here: the crises we are going through confirm more than ever the need to profoundly modify the current European rules. Our Parliament must take up the issue, demand accountability, put the subject on the table. We, here in the European Parliament, are the only elected representatives within the European institutions.

We in Parliament were the first to call for this, and continuing to support Ukraine and Moldova, as provided for, is absolutely correct. However, it is unacceptable that the Western Balkan states have had to wait so long for EU accession talks and that we have ultimately made no progress whatsoever.

How can it be that accession talks with Albania have been repeatedly postponed, even though Albania has had candidate status since 2010? Far too little has happened there, and the problem, of course, is unanimity in the Council. That is precisely where we must begin, and that is why it was right that we called for the establishment of a Convention, in order to finally bring about treaty changes and to finally move away from unanimity for major, important decisions, especially foreign policy issues.

But what surprises me is that not a single word was actually said about how the Union is supposed to function with 30 or 35 members. The leaders took note of the conclusions of the Conference on the Future of Europe, even though we all know that quite a few things in Europe need to change. We still remember how Orbán used that unanimity at the last summit. We know that this unanimity is a godsend for autocrats both inside and outside the Union. Here in Parliament, we have been debating for years about a number of shortcomings in the Union. That is why we – and we as liberals pushed for this – pushed for that conference, pushed for its conclusions, pushed for that convention. Therefore, I would very much like to ask – but he is already gone – our Charles Michel: please promise me that you will fight for that convention and that you will fight for the abolition of unanimity. You have my support.\n",

Just as the rules of navigation were evidently ignored back then, today all the rules of the European Union are also being cast aside. You have long since buried Maastricht, the important question of budgetary discipline. You have long since buried Schengen and Dublin, where anyone can travel freely within this European Union and enter it without proper control mechanisms. And now the Copenhagen criteria, with Ukraine and Moldova being granted candidate status. It's similar with the sanctions policy: six packages that have been imposed, and the fact that the sanctioned party is then far less affected than those who impose the sanctions. Because the sanctioned party sells oil and gas to India and China and sells it back to us at a high price. I can only appeal to you: adhere to the rulebook of this European Union accordingly, and stop imposing sanctions that only harm us and are a shot in the foot.\n",

Due to rising costs, the lives of millions of citizens within the European Union have become unaffordable. From energy to food, from housing to healthcare. And what did the European Council decide last week? Not that the exorbitant Green Deal would be put on hold, and that affordability and security of energy supply would be prioritised. Not that the purchasing power of our citizens needs to be restored. Not that we would focus on additional border security to stop the influx of immigrants. If only that were true! No, instead, the European Council decided to make Ukraine and Moldova candidate members of the European Union. They are two extremely poor countries, which have major problems with corruption. The European Union is getting bigger, but not better. Quantity takes precedence over quality. My conclusion is that this EU does not work in the interest of its own people. At least not for the people in the Netherlands, who will ultimately once again be presented with the bill for Brussels' sky-high ambitions.\n",

The decision to continue supporting Ukraine on its path to accession to the Union, along with Moldova, is welcome, but more courage is needed. Our economy is at war; families are struggling to pay their utility bills and buy food, and businesses also have to contend with rising raw material prices. In short, new and urgent measures are required. For months, we have been proposing a cap on the price of gas, an indispensable tool to defend ourselves from rampant inflation, as the G7 also affirmed a few days ago. We could also consider using a replica of the SURE programme to support those countries that help citizens and businesses pay less burdensome bills. In any case, Europe must emerge stronger from this situation. A great European, Václav Havel, wrote that what is needed in politics is the sensitivity to know when, where, how and to whom to speak.

And Parliament has triggered Article 48, and the President of Parliament has also once again put this on record for the Council, stating that they must act. And what are they doing? They are not even present at the debate. It is repeatedly this fear of the goalkeeper facing a penalty kick that endangers the future of Europe.

The recognition of candidate country status for Ukraine and Moldova is certainly an important message of unity and closeness, but we cannot say the same for two countries that have long been candidates, such as Albania and North Macedonia, which once again see their legitimate ambitions disregarded. Never before in history has it been so necessary for the European Union to represent reliability, security, stability. And this applies not only to these countries, but also to our citizens. We must therefore address the issue of energy prices, which are destabilising our economy, with exceptional and urgent measures. The stubborn opposition of some Member States to the proposal put forward by Italy and other countries to set a maximum gas price does not meet the expectations of European families and businesses. A turning point is needed to counter speculation; let us therefore continue on the path set out by REPowerEU and create the conditions to truly become autonomous from Russian fossil fuels.\n",

Meanwhile, Ukraine is receiving 9 billion euros and full military support, but our citizens have to suffer hunger and cold. And this is happening for a war that is not ours, however terrible what is happening there may be.

A year ago, the price of gas was 18 euros; yesterday it was 170 euros per megawatt-hour. A dramatic situation for businesses and families, but one that evidently suits some European governments, which is the same contradiction why Ukraine's candidacy for the European Union is formalised, but the Ukrainian government's request not to exclude gas and nuclear from the energy sources taxonomy is betrayed in the vote we are about to cast shortly.

The European perspective was confirmed for three countries that deserve it and truly need support because of their resistance to Putin's Russia. However, the Western Balkans can, unfortunately, be spoken of with less optimism. The conclusions, except to some extent in the case of Bosnia and Herzegovina, registered no progress. The European perspective in this region was confirmed as early as 19 years ago. The blockades to the start of negotiations with Albania and North Macedonia threaten European credibility. This only proves that the European Union itself must also reform in parallel in order to be able to make such decisions more efficiently. Bosnia and Herzegovina has nevertheless been given a certain chance in an election year, but the ruling policies must not repeat old mistakes.

Similarly, the path of these applicant countries towards European Union membership must be supported, as must the path of the Western Balkan countries. It is clear that actual membership requires significant reforms and great development from all, but the European Union must also reform itself. We will soon have about ten applicant countries, and it is clear that the European Union must strengthen its economic structures, reinforce the implementation of the rule of law, and enhance its foreign policy decision-making capacity, so that we are ready for this enlargement.

Consider Turkey, where claiming that only this country has shown bad faith in its accession process is not tenable. Disillusionment or worse bitterness could eventually colour the relationship between the EU and accession aspirants. As has happened with the EU’s candidacy outreach to the Balkan states. On a more fundamental basis, the EU needs to face out the strategic question that old-timer Henry Kissinger has clearly defined: post Putin and post the EU’s current leaders, Europe will still have to define what relationship it wants with Russia. Does it want Russia as a full partner in a European system or would it like Russia as an Asian power to be held at arm’s length?

      "\tMr. President, on behalf of the majority force in Parliament, I want to congratulate you, President Sassoli, and wish you the best of luck. You have had our votes; I only ask that you do not forget this now or in two and a half years. I also want to congratulate and thank President Tajani, who has always defended the honour and dignity of this Parliament and all its members. Furthermore, I must congratulate both new and veteran colleagues. The responsibility of representing the European people rests on our shoulders. We are the only institution elected by the European people. The one I am not going to congratulate is the Council. With all due respect, President Tusk, you cannot boast about how you have done things, neither in terms of your methods, nor your vetoes, nor your lack of respect for the other institutions. To the extremists — I don't know if they are here today — who last Tuesday turned their backs on the anthem of Europe, I also want to say that we will never turn our backs on the anthem of the United Kingdom. That is the difference between having principles and not having them. Today I speak here on behalf of a deeply pro-European political Group, which has helped build Europe from its foundations; the Group of a founding party of the European Union; a Group that, unlike others, will always be willing to make concessions and sacrifices to reach agreements; a Group proud of its president and the winning candidate in the last European elections, Manfred Weber. Manfred, you have our support! Without intending to, today he represents the spirit of European democracy in the face of the Council. Europe, in addition to appearing democratic, must be democratic. That is why this House has defended the Spitzenkandidat process for years; because we believe that Europeans have the right not only to vote on how they are governed, but also on who governs them. And I tell you one thing: we believed in the Spitzenkandidat yesterday, we believe today, and I assure you that in five years we will continue to believe, because we prefer ballot boxes to closed rooms. The legitimate interests of the governments represented in the Council should not be imposed by the force of the States against the will of the citizens represented in this Parliament. At this point, I will tell you that the European People's Party will support the candidate proposed by the Council, out of responsibility, because she belongs to the political party that won the elections and because at the head of the Commission there will be a capable person ready to fight in defence of Europe's interests. As a political Group, we are also proud that Ursula von der Leyen will be the first woman to lead the European Union, and that she is, precisely, a woman of the centre-right. However, the Council and its candidate will have to negotiate a programme with this House. We invite the members of the Council to share a reflection. The future of Europe must stop being decided behind closed doors and in secret conspiracies. The Spitzenkandidat process is not about a man or a woman. It is about citizens being able to choose the person who governs them in Europe; a truly revolutionary idea: it is called democracy. The Council has the right to propose a candidate for President of the Commission to Parliament. That is true. But the Council does not have the right to ignore all the candidates who have been voted for by European citizens. You, Mr. Tusk, have formed a top leadership of the European Union that excludes Eastern Europe. No one from Eastern Europe is in your package of names. You, Mr. Tusk, have vetoed — yes, vetoed — the candidate for whom more than forty million Europeans voted, the same population as your country or mine. You have vetoed him. You have imposed the structure of the Commission on the candidate for President of the Commission. Not only the structure — even how many vice-presidencies she will have — without consulting her and before Parliament votes on her, which clearly goes against the Treaties. You have tried to tell Parliament who they should appoint as President of the House, and even for how long the Groups should divide the Presidency among themselves. You have gone as far as deciding who will be the president of the European Central Bank as if it were just another political position. That is called poor democratic education. You have proven the Eurosceptics right. Governing from the capitals is also nationalism. None of the presidents who are part of the Council would dare to do in their respective countries what they have done in the Council, because the Constitutional Court would prevent them. If you'll allow me a joke, you are lucky that Article 7 of the Treaty cannot be applied to the Council, because if it could, today, the Commission would have a real problem. You have opened a very serious political conflict between the Council and Parliament over who decides in Europe. And I will tell you one thing: my parliamentary Group is among those who believe that in Europe, the people decide.\n",

      "\tMr President, honourable Members, in the May elections, European citizens sent us a clear message: they trust Europe, but they want change, and I can assure you that my political Group has the commitment and responsibility to drive that change. The person who would have best led that change in the Commission would undoubtedly have been Frans Timmermans. Firstly, due to his status as Spitzenkandidat, who can obtain a majority of votes in this European Parliament, and out of respect for the democratic rules we establish for ourselves. And secondly, and just as important, because our candidate was rejected for defending the values of the Union and the rule of law. Let it be very clear that we will work with renewed energy to ensure those values are respected. But there is an important issue in politics that is also fundamental, and that is consistency. And it is not consistent to come here to tear down the Council's decision and then say that one will vote in favour of it. The truth is, that position is not very consistent. But let us be clear about one thing: the fundamental principle underpinning the European Union is human dignity. And if we were consistent with those values, we would have acted decisively and coordinately long ago to discuss politics in Europe; to discuss how we can respect human rights; to see how we can ensure that the fundamental values of the Union are respected. We must go further. I want to talk about politics and I want to talk about how this Group will lead the changes in Europe. I am glad that the Italian courts have released Captain Carola Rackete. This happens when, indeed, there is separation of powers, and that is why it is essential to preserve the separation of powers against illiberal democracies. But we must go further and prevent these dramatic situations from occurring due to a lack of solidarity in the European Union. It is indecent to criminalise those who save lives and it is indecent to try to gain political advantage from the misfortune of these people. Speaking of politics, and speaking of substance, we will also not support any candidate who intends to remain static in the face of the need for reforms in economic governance, the strengthening of social policies, and ecological transformation. The clock is not waiting. European teenagers tell us this every Friday. Let us act in the face of the global climate emergency; let us not disappoint them. That is why we will be very demanding with the agenda of the next Commission. Climate change demands a transformation that must have two pillars: inclusion, to ensure a just transition, and sustainability. We were disappointed to see the lack of unanimity in fulfilling our commitments adopted in Paris. This Parliament has always been ahead, and our Group will continue to build majorities to urge the Commission and the Council to be more ambitious. And in this regard, I must congratulate the Finnish Presidency of the Council for its proposals for a sustainable future. We continue to talk about politics. We need an ambitious multiannual financial framework to bring about the necessary change; we cannot do more with less. And this Parliament will fight to secure the funds required by the policies we are going to adopt. Do you remember Europe 2020? Well, there are six months left and we have not been able to meet the objectives, to reduce the number of people at risk of poverty and exclusion. Out of twenty million, we have only achieved five. Because while some benefit from the crisis, others continue to pay its consequences, and grand figures are not enough for us. We are interested in people, and we want economic growth to translate into people, the men and women of Europe, being able to live better lives with more social justice. We must change economic governance. We want a social and solidarity economy, and for that, it is necessary to strengthen the European Semester, so that it includes the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and the pillar of social rights. And we also need to reform the monetary union. We cannot wait for another crisis to reform the Eurozone, to provide it with fiscal capacity and a deposit guarantee. But we will not be able to achieve these objectives if we do not also work on a global agenda. We want a strong Europe, to promote human rights, labour, and environmental standards in multilateral agreements. Citizens expect more from us: they expect us to defend social achievements, such as sexual and reproductive rights or the rights of the LGBTI community; to continue making progress so that unjust situations like the gender pay gap are ended once and for all. And, of course, it is in our hands to end the greatest social scourge currently affecting Europe, which is gender-based violence, women who continue to be murdered simply for being women. And, of course, because we are here to provide answers now, we cannot wait any longer. We are here to build a strong Europe based on the values of equality, solidarity, sustainability, and justice, and we will work hand in hand with anyone who defends these objectives. Let us not betray the trust of those who have placed it in us.\n",

I can only express my hope that, together with the new 'Renew Europe' group, we will make the voice of this Parliament heard more. For this voice to be heard more, we primarily need a democratisation of the appointment process for leadership positions in the European Union. These proposals must start from here, because otherwise we can discuss names, we can discuss gender balance, we can discuss geographical balance, but as long as we don't have a democratic and transparent process for electing those who are to lead Europe, we cannot be satisfied. Yes, this time we have some proposals. The colleagues who preceded me in their interventions have expressed their opinions regarding how these individuals were selected. We do not have balance, Mr President, we certainly do not have geographical balance. Eastern Europe, unfortunately, is no longer represented as it was when you were appointed to the position you currently hold. Therefore, we need a way to take into account everything stipulated by the Treaty on European Union, and these things must be translated into a democratic process. Dear Popular and Socialist colleagues, if we truly want a democratic spirit and if we want these lead candidates to be truly representative, let us consider how we can establish a system of transnational electoral lists or lists through which these candidates can be accessible to all European citizens, not just German citizens, not just French or Spanish or Dutch citizens, and so on. These 'Spitzenkandidaten' will be legitimate when every European citizen has access to them and can vote for them. We propose that we do this, and that we start it here in Parliament, because we cannot expect either the Commission or the Council to do something that is our responsibility. The 'Renew Europe' group proposes to you, and will propose to both the Council and Parliament, that we organize a European conference, a conference for the renewal of Europe, for the democratisation of the electoral process, a conference of a sufficiently long duration – two years, two and a half years – which would make proposals together with the Commission, with the Council, with citizens, with non-governmental organisations, to come up with proposals on how we can improve the process we have. I fully agree with Mr González Pons, I fully agree with Iratxe García Pérez that we need people who truly represent Europeans and from whom the Council can then choose. But let's formalise this process, so that we no longer waste time arguing with exchanges of ideas and opinions when it's already too late, when the Council has to choose, and when we have to be able to decide! Let's use this mandate so that by the next elections we have such a mechanism already agreed with Parliament, with the Council, and with the Member States, and let's stop wasting time throwing insults at each other and show European citizens that we are capable of making decisions and capable of representing them! This is what we propose to you, I hope we will have your support, because we have time, from now until the next elections, to go through this process.\n",

Furthermore, we must conclude the process of appointing the European Prosecutor as quickly as possible. We have waited too long for this. This institution must be functional as soon as possible to protect the financial interests of the European Union from corruption and fraud, but, above all, to send a very clear signal that the European Union knows not only how to punish, but also how to prevent, and that European institutions have the tools to do so.\n",

The message must be very clear for the future European Commission regarding these objectives that we also have in Parliament. In this context, the adoption of the new Strategic Agenda 2019-2024, which the Council adopted, is an important step, but it is not enough. From our point of view, we must have such a political agenda established here in the European Parliament. I hope we can continue and complete the process we started with the pro-European political groups in Parliament, through which we establish these priorities and can place them before the future leadership of the European Commission as quickly as possible. Parliament must play a key role in establishing these priorities, and we must do this now, before the appointment of the future President of the European Commission. Otherwise, we risk it being too late again.

I was very moved ten years ago when I first sat in this chamber, moved by the emotion of collectively representing 500 million European citizens. While it is certainly relatively modest on a global scale – 7% – it is the first time humanity has attempted transnational democracy. Remember, on May 26th, 200 million Europeans participated in the election of our Parliament, the very seat of this first transnational democracy.\n",

      "\tIn the wake of the ballot, and to respond to the unprecedented citizen mobilisation, I found myself dreaming that political groups resolutely committed to European integration would decide to forge a project contract together. This project for change would have had no other goal than to find, in this chamber, a broad and stable majority to collectively address the triple environmental, social, and democratic emergency and, in doing so, demonstrate that the European Union works for the benefit of all. This agreement around a project contract would then have allowed the involved groups to designate a personality directly from the elections to embody it, as President of the European Commission.\n",

      "\tA solid and coherent project, a credible personality to embody it, all supported by a broad majority, including the political forces that won the elections. Faced with this, the European Council would have had no other choice but to accept, at the risk, otherwise, of clashing in a sterile confrontation with Parliament, a confrontation from which it would not have emerged victorious. In such a scenario, the European Parliament would have asserted, as never before, its capacity to be the primary democratic expression of the Union's citizens. It would also have provided an answer to the disillusionment with politics.\n",

It is for this scenario that the Greens/European Free Alliance group had been preparing for several months. It was with a view to achieving this that we committed ourselves unreservedly over the past weeks. Certainly, the challenge was enormous, and time was short, but where there is a will, as you know, there is a way. It is here, in the European Parliament itself, that this will was lacking.\n",

A European Council, five days of inglorious haggling where partisan and national considerations took precedence over the project and its embodiment. All this to arrive at a cast whose ability to drive the change our societies need and our fellow citizens expect is questionable.\n",

I would like to thank President Tusk for the kind words he quite explicitly addressed to the political family I have the honour to lead here in the Council. I believe your words are sincere, but I must note that, around the Council table – and indeed, even here in this chamber – this willingness to associate the family of political ecology with the management of the next five years does not seem uniformly shared, and I think that is an understatement.\n",

A Europe at the forefront of the fight for the preservation of our climate, biodiversity, and natural resources; a Europe championing the fight for social, fiscal, economic justice, and for gender equality; a Europe at the forefront of defending human rights and freedoms, and an ever more participatory democracy.

      "\tMr President, President Tusk, honourable colleagues, once again the European institutions have offered an undignified spectacle to the citizens. Anyone who, after the electoral campaign, after the elections of 26 May, had the slightest hope for a change in methods and programmes has been disappointed. The spectacle that has been offered and the interinstitutional clash we have seen unfold in recent days is truly something that European citizens will not be able to understand. The Council decided to throw a questionable method, which Parliament tried to defend, that of the lead candidate , into the bin, and today Parliament and the parliamentary groups complain that there was no respect in the package agreed between the Heads of State and Government. And here too, you demonstrate your hypocrisy and your lack of consistency in following up words with actions. If Parliament truly wants to be respected, if Parliament, or the majority in Parliament, truly wants to defend the lead candidate method, then words can be followed by actions. If you truly want to be consistent, you can vote against the candidate that the Council has proposed for the Presidency of the Commission. If you make such a gesture, you can be considered consistent. Otherwise, your words will remain, as always and as you have often demonstrated, mere words, proving once again that this Institution is worthless and has no say in European decisions.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\tAs for the package proposed by the Council – and of course, we await the programmatic guidelines – the premises, as already stated, do not bode well for a significant change, the kind that European citizens asked us for on 26 May; they do not bode well for a change of direction that can resolve the problems European citizens are facing and where the majority, which has governed Europe until today, has profoundly failed. The economic crisis: today Europe is the continent that grows the least; it is a continent that is falling behind, and this is the consequence of reckless choices made by these institutions, which not only have not been able to help citizens but very often have exacerbated problems. The issue of internal security: those who were present in the last legislature had to experience two very serious attacks in the two seats of Parliament. Today our citizens are not able to move around our cities safely, and in this regard, these institutions have not been able to provide a response. And the third point concerns the management of migratory flows: as long as we are not able to protect our external borders, as long as we are not able to protect our citizens, these institutions will not only never find an agreement on how to redistribute those who have the right to enter Europe, but the risk is that this continent will be crushed by migratory flows that are unsustainable.\n",

      "\tAs for what the Identity and Democracy group will do in the coming years, despite the fact that this majority or the coming majority has decided, once again, to demonstrate that this Institution is not a democratic Institution, by excluding those who represent almost 20% of the Members of this Assembly, we will continue to work to combat a failing vision of Europe, to combat centralisation in Brussels, and to establish that, if Europe wants to save itself, it must start again from the Member States, from the nation-states, which are the only space of true democracy. We will continue to work to challenge the rhetoric of \"TINA\" (There Is No Alternative), what you propose to us every time to solve European problems, which is to give ever more powers to bureaucrats far removed from citizens. No, this is not the Europe that citizens want. This is not the Europe we want, and if you continue in this direction, Europe truly risks dissolution. The divergences between Member States and between institutions continue to widen, and we will not go in any direction. The Identity and Democracy group will start from this vision: a Europe where Member States guide European cooperation and protect the diversities that you wish to standardise by law.\n",

      "\tMr President, congratulations and all the best. I think the most obvious conclusion that comes from the last Council is that the Spitzenkandidaten mechanism is dead. It is dead and gone. It’s even more dead than the parrot in the Monty Python sketch. I’m not sorry that it is dead because, look, there is nothing about Spitzenkandidat in the Treaties. Not a single sentence, not a single word, nothing. I know of course that the attitude of many people in European politics, including this Chamber, towards the rules and the Treaties has been consistently cavalier, to say the least. Mr Timmermans was not a candidate of the people, of the European people. Mr Timmermans was a candidate of the left-wing political establishment and it is good that he has gone. And I hope he will not return, because essentially the Spitzenkandidat process was to conserve the power of the existing political establishment in Europe, not to open the political space for the people. Far from it. On the contrary. We have problems with rules all the time, and the European Parliament has had consistent problems with respecting the rules. Yesterday we had a lamentable spectacle which showed how a lot of people here are openly disdainful of the rules. President Tusk, of course the Council has no right whatsoever to indicate the Vice-President of the Commission – that is a blatant violation of the Treaty. It is the sole discretionary power of the President of the Commission. So, as I say, the Council is not blameless either. But there is good news, I think. The good news from the last Council is that the EU big guys failed to achieve what they wanted – they wanted to impose their own concept, their own power structure, on the rest of the Member States, with the expectation that it would be humbly accepted. Well it was not, and I hope that some lessons were drawn from that and that it will result in a change of practice. The days when two or three governments and their acolytes could dictate the solutions – even the names – to the entire European continent, are gone. What I am worried about when I hear my predecessor here is that you, ladies and gentlemen, don’t seem to draw any lessons from what happened in the elections. You seem to be determined to continue the same strategy. The number of people who are openly critical of this strategy is increasing. There are more people critical of the strategy now than there were five years ago. And the number is continuing to rise. Yet you seem to be blind and deaf – you don’t hear any warning signals, but you should, because if you do not change course then the consequences will be disastrous. As I said, there is a slight signal from the last Council that things might get better – at least I was hopeful of that – but I lost a lot of hope when I came here and listened to what most of you have said. However, when the milk is spilt please remember that I warned you.\n",

We expect nothing less from you than to be a President who stands for transparency, for impartiality, and who also knows how to defend the rights of Parliament against the Council and also against the Commission. This brings me to the actual topic: The Council, Mr President Tusk, has now found a solution in the personnel poker, and some colleagues have complained about the result, although their political families were intensively involved in it. I want to tell you clearly at this point that the real scandal is that such solutions are found in backrooms, that solutions are worked on intransparently, without involving Parliament, and that actually make a mockery of democracy in Europe. The trust of the voters is thereby disappointed, and great damage is done to European democracy. The people outside the backrooms and also outside the upscale restaurants where these talks are said to have taken place get the impression that it's only about positions and no longer about substance. But we, as the Left in the European Parliament, have received a mandate from millions of voters to fight for a progressive political change here in Europe, in the European Union. And we gladly accept this mandate. Now, some groups, some colleagues, have been negotiating intensively with each other in recent weeks and have tried to put together a common coalition agreement. This has also been mentioned – meaning the Greens, the Social Democrats, also the Liberals and also the Conservatives. I think that minimal consensuses do not do justice to the political challenges of our time. The Left Group wants to take effective measures against the climate emergency. For that, progressive majorities are needed in this House. We want to strengthen social rights in the EU, we want to tackle tax dumping, tax evasion, and money laundering. For that, too, progressive majorities are needed in this House. And, Commissioner, the Commission recently celebrated the planned EU-Mercosur free trade agreement with great fanfare. I want to tell you that for my group, it is completely unacceptable that this agreement be signed. It cannot be the policy of the European Union to throw human rights, social rights, environmental standards overboard for a few euros! And furthermore, this agreement is also to be signed with the far-right government in Brazil. It is precisely such a policy that makes the far-right acceptable in the first place! This meets with our firm opposition. No one understands this anymore! I call on my colleagues here in Parliament to take a stand with us against this planned free trade agreement. Yes, the Left Group advocates for a humane migration and asylum policy in the EU that guarantees universal human rights. And yes, we are therefore very pleased that in the confrontation between Captain Carola Rackete and the self-proclaimed Il Capitano, it's one-nil to Carola. I think we can continue like this. We invite the progressive forces in this House: Let us work together on a progressive political change for the European Union!

But, President Tusk, what legacy are you leaving from the Council? A lack of transparency, a total imbalance in the European institutions, between East and West, and I'm not referring only to the leaders of the three institutions, I'm also referring to the officials working in the European institutions. Please check the balance between employees in the European institutions, between Eastern and Western states. And what else are you leaving, Mr President? An incoherent strategy regarding the enlargement of the European Union, a procedure inconsistent with democracy, namely, the majority in the Council, and you are leaving two states punished - Bulgaria and Romania - even though we have the Parliament's resolution, Mr President, and you promised countless times that you would end your mandate with Romania and Bulgaria in Schengen, because we have met all the technical conditions since 2011. And what else are you leaving, Mr President? You leave the impression that everything is arranged behind a curtain, and this does not encourage European citizens to increase their trust in the European Union. Therefore, dear new colleagues, please understand that it depends on us to increase the importance and power of the European Parliament.

However, in this last election, it is the first time that voter turnout has risen above 50% after having declined election after election. Why? Because of the motivating force that when citizens vote, they decisively influence the leadership of the European Commission, its presidency, and you have been unable to exercise your authority to preserve the candidates who faced the electorate, not even candidate Frans Timmermans, who was vetoed by states that were called to account, precisely because of Timmermans' defense of the rule of law and democracy. But this Parliament has the final say not only in the investiture of the candidate for President of the Commission but also in that of each and every one of the twenty-eight candidates to be members of the Commission. And it would do well to rigorously examine and reject those who do not commit to the social, climate, and digital challenges, but also to the approach to migration, which must be changed to prevent the criminalization of those who save lives at sea — as has been done with the captain of the Sea Watch — or to ensure that the European Union lives up to its humanitarian action to prevent returns to unsafe countries like Libya — where a refugee camp has been bombed with a criminal toll of forty fatalities.\n",

To that extent, the 'spitzenkandidaten' process constituted a very positive step forward, increasing the transparency of political choices in the European Union and conferring reinforced legitimacy on the European Commission. The demonstrated inability to successfully conclude the 'spitzenkandidaten' process was, therefore, quite negative for the necessary strengthening of the proximity between citizens and institutions. Nevertheless, this should not make us lose focus on what is most important for citizens, which are the concrete policies that must be implemented for the European Union to be fairer, more cohesive, and sustainable.\n",

Geographical balance did not fare as well, as there are no representatives from Eastern Europe and the Nordic countries in top positions, nor did the European People's Party, which had to retreat from the Spitzenkandidaten system it strongly supported.

The compromise and the protagonists found confirm the insistence on deepening federalist policies that affront the sovereignty of States; neoliberal policies that attack labour and social rights, public services, and the social functions of the State; militarist and security policies, with authoritarian and anti-democratic expressions – policies that fuel the far-right. The decisions of the European Council prove the falsity and manipulative nature of electioneering statements about the \"social dimension\", \"social contracts\", \"progressive alliances\", or \"democratic legitimacy\" of the EU. It was once again the directory of EU powers that dictated the political outcome of a process that will continue on a path already proven disastrous for workers and peoples. For our part, we will continue to uncompromisingly defend the interests of workers, the people, and the Country, presenting proposals that allow us to seize all opportunities for the development of the Country.

      "\tMr President, I regret that Donald Tusk is not with us today, because I have had a new experience when discussing the informal Council experience. I am quite fine with the outcome of the meeting on Friday. That is why I regret that he is not present with us, because, first of all, in the preparations for 2019, the EPP Group is very thankful that we can agree on the composition and that we have legal certainty for 2019, which is important. Secondly, as regards the Spitzenkandidat, the role is clear. The Council is insisting on its role, which is legally defined in the Lisbon Treaty, and that is fine. However, I also see that the same personalities who stressed, in the informal meeting on Friday, the role of the Council are part of the party meetings, and there they are supporting the process to nominate candidates in the party format. My party will do this in Helsinki in November. That is agreed upon and that is what we will do. Frans Timmermans explained once again what parliamentary democracy means. It is not the biggest group which will have the chance, but only the candidate who can organise a majority will have the chance to be elected as Commission President. However, one thing is again crystal clear: nobody will be elected from this Parliament and from the next Parliament who was not, before the elections, put forward as a candidate from a democratic party. That is a principle. It is fixed and it has now been approved. The innovation that is ahead of us is that we need not only candidates, but we also really need attractive programmes from the different political parties to show people an alternative and to make a really European campaign. On MFF, things are on the right path. It was a constructive discussion. First of all, we have to make the EU more effective and spend money in a more effective way. Then there are the new tasks on the table, and we will need fresh new money. I sometimes hear the argument that the EU will be smaller. Dear friends, when I look at the tasks on the table – the demands for the African Fund, for the Defence Fund and for strengthening Frontex – I do not see how Europe will be smaller in the next MFF. There are lot of tasks on the table which have to be financed. The last point I want to make in my intervention today is about the most important discussion this week on Brexit, because tomorrow Theresa May will make a speech on this subject. When I look to the outcome and the developments in the last weeks in the British debate, the key question is still what the new relationship between the European Union and Great Britain will look like. One principle is clear for us: a country outside the EU cannot have the same standards and the same rights as a country inside the European Union. It is also clear for us that an endless transition period is not acceptable to us. That is why we welcome today’s presentation of a possible Leave Treaty. One point is still open, and that is the question of what these long-term relationships will look like. We need clarity on this. We hope that, when we listen tomorrow to Theresa May, we will have more clarity, for example on the future relationship with the City of London and how the Open Skies will look in the future. There are many questions on the table and we need a clear idea. I have to pick up one message we received from the UK Foreign Secretary, Boris Johnson. When I look at what he said, especially on the question of the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland, I must say that a politician should try to solve problems and not create problems. Don’t play with the achievements of the past; don’t play with the peace process; don’t play with the future of the young generation in Northern Ireland. The EPP will be on the side of the Irish people: we will not accept a hard border, and will not risk the peace process. That is what we want to achieve. Europe is ready. We hope that London is also already.\n",

      "\tMr President, thank you for informing us about what Mr Tusk told you regarding the conclusions. Frans Timmermans on behalf of the Commission, thank you for drawing the conclusions, a lot of which we share, not all of them but a lot. But the main question today is: where is the European Council? I haven’t met the European Council on the floors of this chamber. I have not seen them here. Thanks to our Bulgarian colleagues, there is not even an empty chair and there is not even an elephant in the room. There’s just nothing. I do not regret that, my dear colleague Manfred Weber – I find it a scandal – because this is about the future of Europe, and where is the President of the European Council? He will learn to take this House seriously, and he and his colleagues will learn to take this Chamber of European parliamentarians seriously because it’s about our common future, and we will not give in on these kinds of procedures. The future of Europe is about money – of course. That's why it's completely incomprehensible why so little comes out of it. These informal summits were introduced to make things easier, so that you can speak more confidently. But what is the result? What should the formal summits look like when the informal ones already reveal so little? Of course we agree to take on new tasks. Of course we know that Europe has to take care of a decent refugee policy and that we have to ensure that migration issues are dealt with sensibly. And that we care about security, old security issues - new security issues. That is our clear position. But how is this supposed to work without additional funding? Where is the commitment from the ladies and gentlemen in the European Council to allow us more of this? And in particular: where is the question of own resources? Thank you, Mr. President, for mentioning this again, that is how we discussed it. But why - it is in the hands of the people in the European Council - not finally a financial transaction tax that contributes to Europe's budget? Why not finally impose a tax on the multinationals that do business online without paying decent taxes? It's high time for that, and that's exactly what has to happen, that's exactly what has to be implemented. We are waiting for it. The European Council says that it does not agree or cannot guarantee that the leading candidates will be proposed at the end of the day or that the election will take place from among the leading candidates. We have to say to Mister Tusk and the colleagues: We could not care less. Why? We couldn't care less, because the question of whether the European parties nominate top candidates is not the property of the European Council, but of European civil society, and the parties and the citizens will make a decision on this, and not the rulers and the ladies in the European Council, it won't be like that! That is why I make it very clear: This House has committed itself not to elect anyone who has not faced this democratic competition for programs and people. We in the Socialist Group will certainly not do that because we were the pioneers of this process. We will not elect anyone who withdraws from democratic competition. We will no longer condone backroom events. We want democracy for European citizens.\n",

      "\tMr President, with friends like that, who needs enemies? Can I come back another time? (Referring toremarks made by members of the EFDDGroup.) So what came out of last Friday’s Council meeting? A clear signal that there is still a long way to go to persuade Member States to sign up to a bigger budget and also how to select the next Commission President. A number of EU Member State governments know that their voters do not want them to simply sign blank cheques to fund the ambitions of the Commission and the leaders of two or three of the larger Member States. Members of this House can no longer dismiss those voters, those politicians and those governments who question the agenda of political integration or simply label them as being anti-EU, for once you step outside the EU bubble, it is clear that the call for more Europe, whatever the problem, is the voice of an elite, not the voice of citizens in many of our countries. National governments and voters want to feel that they get value out of the EU for what they pay in. Not all of them want to see a 1950s agenda of political integration. On the whole, the voters want to see a budget that is well managed and matches their priorities, a budget that provides security and well—functioning asylum and immigration systems, and a budget that encourages a cleaner environment, innovation and job creation. But – and members of the ECR Group would want me to be very clear on this point – a budget should not be used to buy solidarity, to bribe Member States into taking asylum seekers, or to control or punish the actions of individual Member States, especially when the Member State pushing for the policy itself broke the rules and, in the process, nearly destroyed the EU’s asylum system. So, as President Tusk has already admitted, agreeing a budget before the next election is probably unrealistic, but even if all of you here and the EU institutions cannot agree on a budget, those politicians facing their electorates in 2019 should all be clear about what modernising the budget really means, about how the EU will face the massive hole after the UK leaves, and whether the EU budget will be one of coercion rather than cooperation between 27 equal Member States. So the ECR Group’s question to the Council and the Commission is simple: Is the EU facing a future where decisions continue to be made by all 27 Member States, or a future where decisions are dictated by the few?\n",
      "[ ] 7: Guy Verhofstadt (ELDR/ALDE/Renew - liberal) [0% migration]\n",
      "\tMr President, first of all we have to thank Mr Kamall for all the recommendations he is giving for the next budget, in which Britain will no longer be involved. Thank you Mr Kamall. Secondly, I think we have to pay you, Mr President, a double salary in February because you have taken over the role of Mr Tusk today and that is significant because you, Mr Timmermans, spoke of the idea of ‘one hat’ in the European Union, and we have proved that it is possible for the Commission to double-hat for the Council. The only other thing, maybe, is that you can go over to the other side once, and then come back. But I will not go over the whole discussion that you had in that informal Council about Spitzenkandidaten and transnational lists. I have already said what I think about that, namely that you are making an enormous strategic mistake. You are endangering the Spitzenkandidat concept by not embedding it in a democratic process in a transnational list. The reality is that the Spitzenkandidat continues to be a toy of political parties and again between the Council on the one hand and Parliament on the other, but there is no legitimacy on the democratic front. Transnational lists provide precisely that – putting the Spitzenkandidat concept into a democratic process so it is our people who decide who is elected, and then the European Council could no longer object to the outcome of such an election. But okay: Rome was not built, as you know Mr President, in a day, and the same is true of transnational democracy. We will come back to this in 2024. On the issue of the budget, I have been involved three times in the adoption of the Multiannual Financial Framework , twice as a member of the Council and once as a Member of the European Parliament, and my fear is very simple, Mr Timmermans: that it will be business as usual. It will be a budget for seven years in which the next Parliament will have no say – no say in five years! Secondly, I fear it will be again a list of 50-60 rebates, exceptions, earmarkings, and exceptional monies to buy the support of all the Member States, and 80% of it will be money paid by the Member States going back to the Member States, and not going to the new priorities that we have – border management, innovation, migration, defence and things like that. So my appeal to all the political groups represented here is: let’s break the cycle of this European budget. Let’s make an agreement, together with the Commission, on the priorities. Secondly, on conditionality: will we continue to hear, for example, that Mr Orban is misusing European money to build a football stadium in his town, or to make his friends and family multimillionaires on the basis of European money? No! Let us establish conditionality: if you don’t accept the values, you don’t need our money. That must be the principle. And thirdly, on the issue of our responsibility. This is the only Parliament, colleagues, which has no say about income: the only one worldwide which has nothing to say about revenue. That has to change, and that means Article 311 of the Treaty, once there is a change to the Treaty, will need to incorporate co-decision by the European Parliament on income. My plea to you – and it is more important for me than the period of five years or of seven years – is that, for once, we have can cohesion in this Parliament, unity in this Parliament, on our refusal ever to accept an MFF without co-decision by Parliament on the issue of revenue. That said, if we do not decide before the next election, it will not be the fault of this Parliament. I’m pretty sure that the European Council will not be capable of reaching agreement on the next MFF before the elections.\n",

      "\tMr. President, the results of the informal Council unfortunately confirm that the Union continues the same neoliberal policies, circumventing declared principles as well as the interests of the people. In relation to the multi-annual budgetary framework, instead of discussing solidarity measures to deal with the refugee crisis, it was proposed to increase spending on the creation of Fortress Europe, by strengthening borders and patrols. Union leaders also agreed to increase investment in the military industry instead of proposing measures to support the real economy, to promote funds and investments for social and regional cohesion, to fight poverty, for employment and the creation of new quality jobs work. The policies they are promoting will not benefit the people but will lead to new conflicts, to new waves of refugees. The current humanitarian crisis in Syria is, I think, typical. Regarding the relations of the European Union with Turkey, the declaration-appeal after the informal Council of President Tusk to end the violations in the Eastern Mediterranean and the Aegean is positive but not enough. Turkey prevented a drilling rig of the European Italian company ENI from proceeding with exploratory drilling in the Cyprus Exclusive Economic Zone and to this day continues to violate international law and the Law of the Sea with illegal Navtex. It continues the flagrant violations of the sovereign rights of the Republic of Cyprus. We therefore expect practical solidarity from the European Union and more drastic measures, i.e. we expect pressure to be exerted on Turkey to immediately stop the illegal actions, to respect the sovereign rights of the Republic of Cyprus and to support the resumption of the talks from where they left off during the last talks in Crans-Montana, so that we can finally lead to the solution of the Cyprus issue. I would like to remind you that on the issue of the future management of natural gas there have already been convergences between the two leaders of the two communities since 2010, to which UN Secretary General António Guterres also refers in his latest report. These convergences resolve the issue as a whole in the interest of the entire Cypriot people, Greek Cypriots and Turkish Cypriots, since with the solution of the Cypriot conflict and the reunification of Cyprus, both will reap the benefits of natural gas.\n",

      "\tMr President, how we set up our long—term budget obviously reflects how we want to deal with the European Union overall, and there I do see some cause for concern. Some Member States say they just want to have enough money for their national pet projects, they want money for their farmers, they want internal security and external security, a lot of things, but they also want to pay less money, and that simply cannot work because a strong and active European Union needs resources. That does not mean that we can just spend it how we want. We have to be careful with where we invest taxpayers’ money, and I can think of quite a few cases where we can save on some of them, from big pie—in—the—sky projects like ITER to the way we choose to travel ourselves, dear colleagues. There are also plenty of examples of how EU money is being misspent in the Member States, and there we need more control and more guidance before the damage is done. EU money always needs to be spent well and in the interests of the people living in Europe, and it must never, ever contribute to corruption. The fight between Member States about who should pay what shows that we need to put the EU’s budget on a more independent footing. Own resources should be introduced now and we think they should be done in a way that enables us to actually tax and take the money from what is destroying our very own habitat. The budget will always reflect what we value most. It is a tool to finance the vision that we have for this place where we all live, for the future, and we must put the money where we think the EU should be going. We should not forget either that we have actually agreed some important international commitments. I am thinking of the Paris Agreement and climate protection, sustainable development goals, to name just a few. But money alone does not bring happiness. What we also need in the Union is a strengthened European debate and to bring decision-making closer to EU citizens, and that is where the whole discussion about the leading candidates comes in. Sure, that concept does not solve all the problems that we have, but it was – and it is – a vital step forward for a more accountable Commission and, more generally, a more accountable European Union. If Member States were to give up that progress because they were afraid that they themselves might not win or because they prefer to have some backroom deals, then this really is a slap in the face of European democracy, and whoever goes down that path should not be surprised if Europe herself gets up at some point and slaps back.\n",

I will say something about Brexit. What the Commission is proposing is not a withdrawal agreement so much as a ‘UK not really leaving at all’ agreement – leaving in name, but not in reality. You intend to impede and delay that process and overturn it if at all possible. Now I do not blame you, because you do not want us to leave and you have no incentive whatsoever to help us do it, but I do blame the British Prime Minister. What Britain needs now is a leader with the courage and spirit of a Boadicea, and instead we have got ‘Theresa the Appeaser’. In the referendum, the British people voted to leave the European Union, and what that means is that we don’t give any more money to the European Union. It means we are not bound by European Union law. It means we don’t have open borders and it means that we are not subject to the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. To make that happen, the Government should take control of the process. The British Government should stop asking the European Union how it might leave please, and it should start telling them how it’s going to work.\n",

But now that England is leaving the EU, there is less money, much less: between 14 and 25 billion euros per year. Most Member States, we heard on Friday, do not want to pay more. And so Mr Verhofstadt, the ALDE Group calls, for direct EU taxes. That solves the problem. You don't see it in the national budget, but the citizen does pay for it. The other Europhile parties here agree with this. The citizen is screwed again. The citizen pays for this failing project. I tell you: the EU should not spend more, but less. The budget should not be higher, but lower. Citizens should not pay more, but less.

These are principles that we should not argue about, and this should not be understood as pressuring people. But I would like to say one thing about the European Council and ultimately just take up one topic. A year before the European elections, that is the question of how we can bring our political project even more clearly to voters. There was a crucial point in the Treaty of Lisbon, which we rehearsed last time when we were electing the President of the Commission, but which the political parties have not yet brought into the political debate in full and in the same way everywhere: that is the question of the top candidate. We want the future to proceed as the Treaty provides - and we will not allow the European Council to pursue its own interests in the back rooms. We would like to state that in the future the head of the European administration will be elected by voters through the European Parliament, as the Treaty provides, and that this will not be a caprice between heads of government. If we do not bring this Europe closer to the citizens in the decisive positions, then this Europe will have no chance in the long term.

      "\tMr President, at their last meeting some leaders proved that they are not really understanding what a budget to pave the way for a better future in the European Union should be. Of course we need to cope with new challenges – for example, managing migration means Europe delivering on better cooperation in development and peace-building with its entire neighbourhood – that’s for sure. But Europe also need to be ambitious on programmes which have proved to be a success, such as Erasmus, the programme for science and technology or the youth initiative. Most of all, we need to ensure strong means to provide social and territorial cohesion in Europe, because without that there is no unity among European citizens. This also means – because convergence is a central problem for us – that, when it comes to the eurozone, we need to include a fiscal capacity in the upcoming Multiannual Financial Framework. So how can we deliver on all this? Well, the answer is easy. We have to accept, once and for all, that we need new own resources to finance our common budget. And there is a further matter on which the leaders were too shy, namely the right way to understand European democracy, because some of them are hesitant about the need for European parties to put up their own candidates in European elections, presenting their own programmes in such a way that citizens can choose not only legislators but also executive power.

Are you aware of the fact that, economically, Brexit is equivalent to 19 countries leaving the European Union at the same time? There are very complex logistical supply chains in danger – customer relationships, supplier relationships – and, in the end, Britain will become the largest British customer. I wonder why we are continuing to try to punish Britain for their decision. Instead the Commission should focus on placing the interests of the European Union as priority number one. Those interests are very similar to Britain’s interests. Any deal which is good for British industry is also a very good deal for European industry, and that is why I believe we should change the Commission’s priorities.

So please, let's get away from sterile opposition, from competition between cohesion and agriculture or, worse still, from situations where solidarity is sacrificed for the benefit of security.

The CAP must become the instrument of food autonomy that respects the soil, the water and those who work there, and of course us who feed on it. As for cohesion, it is our key to converging towards development for all people, all regions, environmental and social development.

To paraphrase Margaret Thatcher, we have not voted successively to take back control of our frontiers in Britain only to see them reimposed at a European level, in a European superstate, exercising a new dominance from Brussels. No, no, no. The UK is not for turning. And the only common sense that has been spoken in this Chamber today was the ECR’s Mr Henkel. What matters is people’s jobs, industry and their GDP. Your companies want to have a free-trade deal with us. Our companies want to have a free-trade deal with you. If you do not want to see this Parliament split apart – because that is what is happening because of the populist vote: my side of the Parliament is actually gaining control of governments or being in opposition – then I suggest you listen to Mr Henkel if you don’t listen to us.\n",

Before the meeting of the European Council, the President asked three questions in his letter regarding, firstly, priorities, secondly, the size of the budget, and thirdly, the calendar. After the European Council meeting, we received a communication on which we wonder whether it is good or bad news for Parliament. As for the content, we in the European Parliament's Committee on Budgets tried to answer these questions, also assuming that they would be asked later. In our position, which we adopted the day before the European Council, we made it clear how we wanted to treat the new priorities, and we agree with the European Council on this point. Secondly, we talked about the size of the budget, and here the reaction of the European Council is not yet clear, which is good news because it means that a certain proposal is not rejected today. As for the calendar, there is no clear answer for today either, which we also consider a positive rather than a negative sign. In other words, the European Council has left the door open and a serious debate with the European Parliament is beginning.\n",

At home we are then confronted with disappointed expectations. People will then succinctly claim that the EU doesn't work. Things have become too confusing for people, and because no responsibilities can be determined, skepticism and rejection often arise. This time the heads of state and government had it in their hands to take an important step. Whatever you may feel about the top candidate principle, it is definitely an important contribution to establishing accountability. The representatives of the Member States preferred to put things off rather than make concrete proposals.

On the budget, it’s clear that it’s not set in stone. We need to adopt the budget so it represents the real needs and concerns of our citizens. We wholeheartedly support additional EU spending to stop illegal migration, trafficking and to counter human smugglers and criminal networks who prey on those who are already most vulnerable. But at the same time Europe cannot and will not isolate itself from the world. We need to step up our engagement with and in Africa. The MFF should be a cornerstone in a new Marshall Plan for Africa, so we can help those who are most vulnerable more, help them sooner and help them where they are.\n",

To do this we need - we wrote it in our documents, we said it to the Commission and the Council - a budget that is strong, a budget that is able to respond to citizens' expectations, that is able to respond to the expectations of our businesses, of our economic world, of our world of work. To have a strong budget, you need to have European resources, very strong own resources: on this it seems to me that there is very little push from the Council and that there is no will to move forward. We, however, believe that it is necessary to free up resources for the Member States and, at the same time, to have a Europe that is able to provide for at least 50% of its needs, of its budget, on its own.

I believe that these actions are directed directly against the European Union. When it violates the Exclusive Economic Zone of Cyprus, it violates the external and maritime borders of the European Union. When it targets the energy plans of Cyprus, it targets and hits the European Union itself. When Turkey obstructs European companies, such as ENI and TOTAL, it hurts European Union companies, it hurts the very interests of the EU. Turkey today, with all these provocative actions, is a challenge and an insult to the European Union itself. Because Turkey only understands the language of sanctions and measures, I believe that we must rethink any Euro-Turkish relations, the upgrading of the Customs Union which is unthinkable and unacceptable, the liberalization of visas for Turkish citizens, but also something more important and most important, on of which the European Parliament also has a say, the financing with funds from the European Funds.

Those priorities should be security, solving migration, and I am very happy that the European Council signed up to the Erasmus+ program, because education, youth mobility, that is the future of the EU. Also a condition for Turkey to take place next month in Varna, Turkey's activities in the Mediterranean and in Syria must be ended and human rights should also be added, because the imprisonment of journalists and academics is unacceptable to us.

This issue needs to be given further consideration both by the European Parliament and by the Council. Both sides seem to be making assumptions about democracy and political legitimacy that have little to no resonance among European people. Another point discussed was the upcoming Multiannual Financial Framework. Given new priorities and the funding vacuum being created through Brexit, there is clearly a need to explore other ways of funding. When proposing own resources for EU funding, the economic sensitivities of each Member State must be duly respected. Similarly, new funding priorities should not downgrade cohesion as a crucial tool of European policy. They must take into consideration the different constitutions of the Member States. Defence has now emerged for some as a leading priority. The EU as of now is not a military union. Defence spending should be kept separate from the common MFF.

Creating undue linkages with other sectorial agenda would compromise their effectiveness and added value. This does not mean conditionalities shouldn’t be put in place. The Rule of Law is a basic prerequisite not only for participating in the European project but also in the common market, and they could be included in one way or another in close linkage with the spending of the budget.

Direct payments financed from it constitute as much as 50% of farmers' income - income that amounts to only half of the income of other professional groups. Low farmers' incomes are the reason for the lack of young farmers. The financial situation of farmers without the CAP would be catastrophic. Let us remember that the CAP benefits not only farmers, but all consumers, because thanks to CAP funds, food is cheaper and the purchase of production means increases, which also improves the situation of the machinery and chemical industries and trade. The CAP ensured food security in terms of universal access to food of adequate quality and affordable prices. Farmers provide society with a number of public goods in the field of the environment and landscaping, for which they are not remunerated.

      "\tMadam President, President von der Leyen, Council, dear colleagues, as EPP, we are, first of all, happy to have the debate today. Such an upgraded top-level debate about the Defence Union. EPP was asking for this for a long period of time and that’s why it is good to have it. For us, first of all, I want to underline that the subject itself is not innovative at all. I said it already in my last speech: in 1945, Adenauer, Schuman, De Gasperi started with the Defence Union. The French Parliament rejected, De Gasperi had tears in his eyes after it failed in the French Parliament. The idea, in 1954, was, after the Second World War, unifying armies, never again war in Europe. What a fascinating idea behind it – and we are back to this debate. We are back to this debate – again we discuss this subject with the idea never again war in Europe. But that means today to be strong, and that’s why we are so happy to have this debate. The first point, from an EPP perspective, is: the debate about NATO-EU is, for us, not a debate at all. The NATO is fundamental for us. We also welcome Finland and Sweden joining the NATO. The EPP parties in Finland always were in favour – even when it was unpopular in the country – in favour of joining. Socialists finally also are supporting now joining the NATO from the both countries, so welcome in the club. But there is a good outcome. We have them now among us and, in the long run, we must understand that 330 million Americans will not defend, in the long run, 440 million Europeans. We have to do it by our own means. That’s why it’s not in contradiction, it’s the same as what we are doing here to strengthen NATO with a strong EU pillar. The concrete actions is now to implement the European single market, and there we welcome very much the presentation of Ursula von der Leyen, the ambitions of Ursula von der Leyen. The Americans have one tank, we have 17 different kinds of tanks. The Americans have 30 weapon systems, we have 160 weapon systems. It’s so obvious that we are wasting money. We have to buy European. We have to care about our jobs. We have to do common export rules for the future, to have common industry in defence. We need to coordinate all this. That’s why the idea to have a Commissioner responsible for doing so is exactly what we need – and on short term, we have to finance it. So, the EIB development is a good one, but I want to add also that, on the taxonomy rules, we have to rethink them, because, currently, taxonomy rules are also an obstacle for financing defence goods. That’s why we have to make it possible that the private sector is financing this. Listening to the Council speaker, I have to say that we heard so much already about these kind of speeches, that it is national responsibility. My clear demand is: stop speaking, please act now, on the Council side. We need also joint actions about the areas where we have an obvious European added value, and it is about cyber defence, about a missile defence shield, about the joint mission, for example, in the future of sub-Sahara to not hand over the region to Wagner troops or to the Islamist terrorists. That is another point for us that we have to care about the current state of play, on defending Ukraine.\n",
      "\t\n",
      "\tAllow me to continue in German. We feel that, unfortunately, the unity in the European Union is crumbling. I am disappointed by what some leaders at national level have said in recent days. Emmanuel Macron has initiated a senseless debate about the question of whether French troops should be deployed in Ukraine. This debate was senseless and it has divided Europe and the Western Hemisphere. And the second thing: The German Chancellor Olaf Scholz has issued the directive in Germany that with the delivery of Taurus missiles, Germany would become a party to the war, which is legally incorrect and which, unfortunately, he had already stated regarding the Leopard tanks, which only confirms Russian propaganda, namely that some parts of Germany, of Europe, could thereby become part of the war. Both leaders have contributed to the division of Europe and not to the unity of Europe. I can only say: Stop it! Putin hates the way we live. Ukraine must not fall. We must stop Russia. Appeasement does not work, as we experienced with Nord Stream 2. And therefore: Thanks to Ursula von der Leyen, Roberta Metsola, Donald Tusk, who was very strong. I would also like to mention Giorgia Meloni, who played a strong role at the G7 summit. We now need people who unite, who show agreement, and not people who divide. And therefore: Putin only understands the method of strength. And I would like to conclude by quoting George Washington: ‘The best way to prevent war is to prepare for it.’\n",

      "\tMadam President, colleagues, this is an important debate, taking place at an existential moment for Europe and the world. One must begin by saying that we responded well to yet another existential threat to the world – that was COVID. We were safe, and Europeans recognise this, but the rest of the world accused us of merely looking after the rich people in the West. We also did well when Putin invaded Ukraine, with an extraordinary effort by our High Representative; we were united from the beginning, sanctioning Putin and delivering weapons to Ukraine. Now, yet another war has reached our borders, increasing the uncertainty of the times in which we live. We cannot simply look the other way when 30,000 people have died in a few months at the hands of the Israeli army in Gaza. The rest of the world is once again questioning our moral compass. But it is we who should be asking, 'What are we doing in these dramatic times?' President von der Leyen, if we want to be safer in the world, we must be a more geopolitical Europe, as you have rightly pointed out at times. But the world will not forgive us for our double standards. The world will not partner with us if they feel left behind, simply because they are not Caucasian or rich. If we want to be more geopolitical, we need to maintain our moral compass, and then we must become geostrategic and truly start mobilising all our instruments. Where are our concrete actions for lasting partnerships with Africa and Latin America? Will we simply yield to President Macron's domestic problems and turn our back on the rest of the world? We cannot continue to hesitate. We need to move forward, not stall our ambition. If we want to be safe, we need to be stronger to make ourselves respected in the world. Where are the funds, the actual funds, that we need for the strategic autonomy of Europe? A greener Europe will also be a safer Europe for the future. Have you told Mr. Weber, President von der Leyen, have you told him this much? Do you know that the EPP is trying to tear down the green policies that we built, also with the work of the Commission, trading the future of Europe and the planet for just a few thousand votes? A Europe with more opportunities for all is also a safer Europe for all. Where are your concrete policies for a more social Europe? Have you forgotten politics for the people, particularly those who suffered the most here in Europe? The EU also lacks proposals to truly confront the threats from China, or even the aggressive IRA of the US. Not with words and strategies, but with resources for our economy to match the ambition of these programmes, particularly those of our Chinese rivals. A global vision, we do need; a strategy, we do need – but we also need concrete tools to act. Where are our teeth when some of our natural allies, let alone our opponents, challenge our common values or interests? What did you do in concrete terms to stop Netanyahu's unacceptable actions in Gaza that followed the madness of Hamas? What did you do to actually promote lasting peace? Why didn't you personally call for an unconditional ceasefire now that millions have their lives threatened in Rafah, Madam President? Guterres and Borrell led by example in this conflict, but from you, I am sorry to say, President von der Leyen, there has been silence in action after a serious initial mistake. A safer Europe will be a Europe that projects its strengths in the world to promote peace, not war, to promote development, not inequalities. A safer Europe will be able to be more relevant in its own defence, saying yes to NATO, saying yes to its neighbours. But it has to be a Europe based on solidarity and knowing that, as always, an eye for an eye will only turn this world into blindness.\n",

      "\tMadam President, Mr. Secretary of State, dear colleagues, for too long, we have ignored the signs of the world's tipping point. Increasingly, our values of freedom and democracy are now under attack, physically or virtually. Despite these threats, we have become too accustomed to a certain comfort. This comfort has at times made us forget the harsh reality that geopolitical upheavals can inflict upon us. The habit of peace, that formidable European miracle, has become a situation taken for granted, while this peace is essential for our freedom, for our prosperity. Dear colleagues, by relying solely on our American allies to ensure our defense, we have ended up with chronic underinvestment in our defense capabilities. The awakening could only be brutal! Two years ago, Vladimir Putin launched a war of invasion on European soil. The worst atrocities have been committed. The gravest threats now hang over our heads. Dear colleagues, since February 24, 2022, naivety has had its day, and that is why, alongside its heroic population, we will support Ukraine until its victory. And we too must be concerned about our own security! Our ties with our allies are precious. To question them would be irresponsible. But from the moment there is a risk that our strategic priorities might diverge, we must no longer prevaricate. We cannot wake up the day after the American elections without having anticipated the world that follows. We, democrats, refuse to leave our union at the mercy of aggressors, unlike those whose links with Putin are known and documented here, on the far right and far left of this chamber. Do not count on them to defend neither our continent nor their own country. Dear colleagues, I would also like to convey a message. There's no point in attacking our Heads of State, here or there. They are key! It's a sterile debate. Otherwise, we can revisit the past and look at who led us to our dependencies. I will not do that! Let us be collectively responsible, otherwise we play into Vladimir Putin's hands. And I ask the question: who better than Europe to protect Europe? Dear colleagues, it is time to act. And this begins by ending unanimity in European foreign policy, a domain where today, a single government, even one beholden to a foreign power, can endanger all our vital interests. We will then need to consider new initiatives, and I am thinking here of the creation of a European Military Academy, at a time when our armed forces must be fully interoperable. But we must also invent new forms of financing for our protection and build a true single defense market so that we can finally protect ourselves. Our collective security depends on it!\n",

      "\tMadam President, dear colleagues, Madam President, Mr Minister! Ukraine is fighting for its freedom and for ours, for a democratic, for a free Europe. For Ukraine's struggle and, of course, for our own security in the European Union, we must finally get serious about a common security and defence policy – not just in empty rhetoric, but in real action. Because only a united Europe – and everyone here knows this – is a secure Europe. Unfortunately, some are currently showing us how not to do it. Instead of coordinating closely internally and providing European leadership, Emmanuel Macron and Olaf Scholz are conspicuous by their obvious disagreements. Macron, who cannot disguise the lack of action from Paris with his political initiatives: France ranks far behind in military aid for Ukraine. Yet we need much more practical help for Ukraine, including from Paris. And Olaf Scholz? Olaf Scholz, unfortunately, is currently notable more for his half-baked statements on international law regarding the Taurus missile than for clear European leadership. This, too, is simply not enough, dear colleagues. Because we are currently at a critical juncture. Two years after Russia's brutal invasion of Ukraine, we need a clear message from Europe that we will support Ukraine so that it can win this war. We therefore need a Franco-German engine right now – united with a pro-European Polish government in the Weimar Triangle – that has the power not only to support Ukraine, but also to finally set the right course for security policy in Europe. Because the figures show it: cooperation in defence policy is still the exception, not the rule, in the European Union. This must change urgently. For years we have not met the self-imposed targets regarding procurement, joint procurement, but also joint research and development in the European Union. This is not only strategically unwise for Europe, but it is also a completely inefficient use of taxpayers' money. This must change urgently, dear colleagues, and not in 15 years, but now – for our security, for Ukraine. Because we could give Putin no better gift than a divided, nationally isolated European security policy. Dear colleagues, one more thing must change: the ideological, dogmatic adherence to the \"black zero\" against all common sense. Not only because we must now jointly invest in security and in our freedom – because yes, the Green Deal is a crucial part of defending our security and freedom, of making us independent from dictators like Vladimir Putin – but also because we must not pit these investments against urgently needed investments, for example, for social cohesion in our societies. A socially divided European Union is not only unjust, but also a danger to our democracy. That is why we must not tire of investing in social justice there too. Colleagues, it is in our hands: Will we allow ourselves to be divided in the coming years, or will we confront Putin with common European strength to jointly defend our values and Europe's security?\n",

      "\tMadam President, President von der Leyen, honourable colleagues, this discussion comes at the end of the legislative term and with grave delay. Over the past five years, in this House, we have spoken much more about electric scooters and butterflies than about geopolitics and military defence. The red-green left's idea of making Europe a herbivorous superpower has entirely occupied the agenda of the European Commission and, consequently, that of Parliament. We have been inundated with grand speeches about the need to cycle to avoid CO2 emissions. We fell asleep in a dream, but in the meantime, the world continued to live in reality, and reality is a beautiful but dangerous place.\n",

      "\tWe European conservatives have always had clear ideas in this regard: we have always believed that the European Union should not deal with everything, but with a few things, albeit important ones: 'Doing less, doing better' has always been our message. The common defence of European borders and interests is one of the few things for which the European Union is truly necessary, and how necessary it is! Because it is obvious that security lies in numbers, and interests do not always coincide on both sides of the Atlantic. Making the European pillar of NATO more solid and efficient also serves to strengthen the Atlantic Alliance. Please, let's not be scandalized when Trump comes to wake us up from our 'green dream': it cannot always be others who pay or die on our behalf.\n",

      "\tHowever, today there is no need to divide ourselves over the prospect of a European army which – allow me a personal digression – the Italian right has supported for 50 years, at a time when today's staunch pro-Europeans were supporting the Red Army. What we can agree on, for now, is better integration of national armies and common arms production, which is costly but necessary, and if done together, can allow us to spend less and better. Courage, realism, and common sense are needed. Despite the delays and some hypocrisy in its aims, the European mission ASPIDES in the Mediterranean is the right path to follow.\n",

      "\tMadam President, the European Union dreams of being a superpower, ultimately possessing its own defence. This is yet another direct infringement on the sovereignty of our nations, which cannot be shared with a European sovereignty that exists only in the ideology of euro-enthusiasts. The soldier is not ready to die for Europe. As the former Chief of Staff of the French Army, Pierre de Villiers, stated: \"One dies for one's leader, one dies for values, one dies for one's homeland. One does not die for a European Economic Community.\" Hailed as a means to strengthen Europe against all threats, the utopian vision of a conglomeration of national armies under the command of officers of other nationalities is unachievable. Alternatively, the pillar for this European defence would have to be NATO, which would primarily protect American interests. And what would become of France's nuclear deterrent? For how can a European defence zone be created without sharing it, which cannot be considered in any way? The temptation is great for President Macron to try and assert himself internationally when he is so challenged domestically, he who has just been resoundingly repudiated by European nations and the United States regarding the deployment of troops to Ukraine. His warlike declarations, added to those of other European officials, have convinced me that if the European Union had possessed an army, it would have committed it, even if it meant dragging us into a deadly escalation in the context of the Russo-Ukrainian conflict. To have a strong Europe, we need strong states first and foremost. So, before seeking to create a European defence, let us strengthen our own armies. They need it so much.\n",

      "\tListening to you, Madam von der Leyen, but also to colleagues from the Greens to the Conservatives, one repeatedly hears the same words: more money for weapons, rearmament, war capability, combat readiness. I find it very easy – and you all make it very easy for yourselves – to hide behind these grandiloquent words to distract from the failure of your own policies. Yet, the inability to manage even one of the current crises is obvious. Social inequality in the European Union is increasing unchecked. Hunger and poverty have become everyday realities for many people once again. The climate crisis continues to worsen. When it comes to migration, all you can think of is abolishing human rights instead of protecting people. And regarding war and peace, one hears nothing but this shrill outcry for rearmament, from which only the large arms corporations will profit. And even social democratic politicians are now cluelessly rambling about a European atomic bomb. And French President Macron wants to send ground troops to Ukraine if necessary. Let me ask you a serious question, Mr. Gahler, for a friend: Have you all gone completely mad? A new arms race will not lead us to security, but directly into the next catastrophe. You are all pursuing a negligently dangerous policy, and brutal austerity measures alongside rearmament mean that people will find less social security, less healthcare, fewer intact schools, while their money is diverted directly into the accounts of major shareholders. This simply cannot be serious anymore. And this policy is the fuel that strengthens the extreme right and endangers democracy. If you want to solve any of humanity's great challenges, a fundamental change in policy is needed towards a strategically independent European Union, which of course must be capable of defence – what else? – but which must also, of course, follow the principles that diplomacy, peaceful conflict resolution, the strengthening of international organizations, and not a new arms race, create the conditions for peace, and which therefore, even if it currently seems unpopular, remains committed to mutual disarmament.

      "\tMr President, Madam President, Minister, ladies and gentlemen, since we adopted our previous report on the implementation of the common foreign and security policy on 18 January last year, the world has changed significantly. While Mr Putin is relentless in his war of aggression against Ukraine, the horror terrorist attacks launched by Hamas against Israel on 7 October have set the Middle East on fire. In our external action, we need to adapt to these new circumstances. For too long, the European Union has been too cautious; we have not proactively defined and defended our interests in the world. This needs to change. I would like to fully underline what our Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, has said this morning in this plenary and it was actually our Commission President, Ursula von der Leyen, who recognised this already back in 2019 when she spoke of a geopolitical Commission and a European Union that needs to understand the language of power. Listening carefully to all the contributions this morning, one thing is obvious: one logical conclusion can only be a strong defence portfolio. But what actually does that mean concretely? Yes, I would like to see a Commissioner for Security and Defence in the next European Commission. She, or perhaps he, should coordinate all EU and Member States defence initiatives and ensure that we are stronger by acting together. Yes, I would want to see EU Member States procure their defence products jointly to improve the interoperability of our armed forces and to reduce the costs for taxpayers. The EU defence industry reinforcement act, EDIRPA, was an important starting point, but it is far from enough. Yes, we must help the European defence industry to increase its production capacity to ensure that our armed forces are fully equipped. We must provide Ukraine with whatever it takes to win this war as long as it takes. Also, in that regard, we made a first step with the act in support of ammunition production. But we urgently, colleagues, need to go further with a future European defence investment programme and by establishing a well-funded Ukraine assistance fund under the European Peace Facility. Ultimately, it is about further establishing a single market for defence. The long-term goal, dear colleagues, is, of course, to develop a true European Defence Union, a fully-fledged European Defence Union. All our activities need to be closely coordinated with NATO, with our transatlantic partners, the Americans, the Canadians, the British. Let us remain transatlantic and at the same time become more European. That is the way forward. And I would once again like to address our Commission President, because since 2019, dear Ursula von der Leyen, you have taken the right approach. You are strengthening Europe’s global footprint and supporting the principles that inspired our own creation, development and enlargement. Since we have discussed my own report extensively in AFET, I will not refer to my own report. I would just like to thank all colleagues involved, especially the shadow rapporteurs, the involved staff members and also the team of the High Representative / Vice-President for the constructive and fruitful cooperation. Since this will be the final report on the implementation of our common foreign and security policy in this legislature, hopefully the next Commission and the next High Representative are invited to use this year’s CFSP report as a guide for their priorities.\n",
      "[ ] 13: Sven Mikser (PSE/S&D - social_democratic) [0% migration]\n",
      "\tMr President, President of the Commission, colleagues, Russia’s aggression against Ukraine has made many of us reassess our previously held convictions and beliefs about European security needs. What is more, it has exposed vulnerabilities caused by decades of underinvestment in defence and security, both in individual Member States as well as at the European Union level. Let me say that, perhaps unlike in Finland or Estonia, the conservatives in some larger countries were also complicit in this strategic naivety. Russia’s brutal aggression against Ukraine must not succeed. It is our moral duty to support the fight for the survival of a sovereign, democratic European nation. But we have to understand that Ukraine’s defeat would also be devastating for EU security and present a mortal threat to the rules-based international order as we know it. Since Putin escalated his war over two years ago, the EU has taken many unprecedented steps. The use of the European Peace Facility to reimburse Member States for equipment donated to Ukraine and the initiative to ramp up production of ammunition and missiles are steps in the right direction. But I am sure that the history books will not judge us based on what we did or spent or what we said in this noble Chamber, but on whether we actually managed to help Ukraine win the war. So we need to do more and do it now. It’s a matter of utmost urgency because while we are talking, Russia is making gains on the ground that will be very difficult and costly to reverse later. We know that Putin’s Russia presents not only a threat limited to the indirect implications of the Ukraine war. There is and will be for the foreseeable future a direct military threat from Russia to EU Member States, territories and people. In order to provide credible deterrence against the threat or, if necessary, defend our continent, we will need to spend more on defence. It’s true that more Member States are spending 2 % of their GDP on defence than did so ten years ago, but we know that several larger Member States still fall short of that important threshold. Also, while we have launched on the EU level important initiatives such as EDF, EDIRPA and ASAP to boost joint research and innovation, promote joint procurement and address critical capability shortfalls, it is imperative that we also put additional money on the table. It is impossible to use the same money twice and cannibalising the budgets of existing programmes to finance newer ones is not going to be sustainable. On the defence-industrial level, I think it’s important that we understand that this new security reality will be with us for the foreseeable future, so our industries must have confidence that the orders from governments will not stop the moment the arms fall silent in Ukraine. Europe’s strategic autonomy, obviously, will not be unlimited. It must always be our first choice to act together with our friends and allies. It would be a great mistake to brush our allies aside just for the sake of going alone. Let me recall the words of NATO Secretary-General Stoltenberg, who recently described the calls for creating a European nuclear deterrent without the US as unhelpful. But at the same time, we cannot fully ignore the uncomfortable truth that Donald Trump may return to the White House next year. Moreover, there is also far less of a consensus on Capitol Hill when it comes to America’s global security responsibilities than just a few years ago. We cannot completely rule out America’s turn to towards greater isolationism, and this possibility underscores the need to build a militarily stronger and more capable Europe. Finally, while we need to be ready to go alone if necessary and build alliances whenever possible, it is clear that beyond collaborating with our most immediate allies and fellow democracies, we are only going to prevail if we manage to form larger coalitions and convince the rest of the world that our cause is just. Immediately after the beginning of Putin’s full-scale war, we managed to pull together a coalition of more than 140 countries in the UN General Assembly. Today, after months of ongoing humanitarian catastrophe in Gaza, recreating such a coalition would be very difficult. I am convinced that every one of us condemns the horrific terror attacks of Hamas and demands the immediate release of all the hostages. The vast majority of us are committed to a two-state solution that provides security for Israel and delivers on the legitimate aspirations of Palestinian people. If it is so, we need to do more, we need to do something very tangible in order to end this unnecessary suffering of millions of displaced and starving people. Only by doing this – which is also a moral obligation – we can convince the rest of the world that we are really committed to maintaining and strengthening the rules-based international order.\n",

      "\tMr President, Madam President, Mr Secretary of State, it's never too late to wake up, even if the Russian war in Ukraine and the speculations about a possible failure of the American ally do not date from today, nor even from two years ago, but from ten years ago. Since then, we have had many grand pronouncements, many incantations, some actions, it is true, but too few and too slowly. And I refer you in this regard to the debates we had right here two years ago, on the eve and in the wake of the famous Versailles summit, where we were promised heaven and earth. But all this has been slow to materialize. How can we ensure today that we will not, once again, be left with declarations that will have no follow-up? First, faced with the urgency, let us avoid losing time and energy in divisive debates, instead of fully mobilizing ourselves on what must unite and bring us together. The absolute priority today is to produce and deliver equipment and ammunition, not to publicly speculate on options that divide Europeans. This applies to the President of the French Republic as well as to the German Chancellor. Next, it must be recognized that there is only one category of producers: companies, and one category of buyers: states. The Commission, and you have explained this very well, Madam President, is not a producer, nor is it a buyer of defense equipment. That is not its role. Its role, as you recalled, is to facilitate and streamline this link between companies and states as directly and simply as possible. In this regard, it is imperative, as Manfred reminded us, and I can only insist on this point, to remove all ambiguity regarding the constraints that discourage public and private funding for the defense industry. The famous taxonomy, whether environmental or social, places too much uncertainty on actors who are ready to commit, but who fear being in contravention of sometimes imprecise or contradictory injunctions. Finally, Member States retain major responsibility and must not shirk it. They place orders, they buy, they deliver. Therefore, let them revitalize the European Peace Facility at the appropriate level, let them adapt the rules of the European Investment Bank, and let them group together or act alone to buy and deliver. But let them do it quickly, the war economy is not about grand gestures, it is about orders.\n",

The war in Ukraine, the pogrom of Jews and the hostage crisis in the Middle East, geopolitical tensions in the Indo-Pacific, and rising tensions in the Western Balkans – all these are challenges to our borders, as well as to internal stability, and the security of European citizens. Allow me also to thank the rapporteur for including my amendment, essential for peace and security, which includes the importance of the principle of power-sharing in Bosnia and Herzegovina, just as power was agreed upon in the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland, through a fair electoral law that respects the judgments of the Constitutional Court, the only body that interprets the Dayton-Paris Peace Agreement on legitimate representation, and the judgments of international courts. A report on preventive diplomacy was recently adopted. These amendments are also included in this report on the Common Foreign and Security Policy, where the international community is asked to reflect on the lessons learned, not to extinguish conflicts, but to prevent them.\n",

      "\tMadam President, the third year of war is already beginning at a time when Ukraine's military situation has deteriorated. The way forward seems clear: we must strengthen and modernize our defence industry and provide ammunition to the Ukrainian army as soon as possible. The European Commission is already acting in this regard: I refer to the European Defence Fund, the Ammunition Production Support Regulation, the so-called EDIRPA Regulation, and other proposals that have not been announced today. I welcome a Commissioner for Defence Industry, but I also wish that, among the Council configurations, there be a Council of Defence Ministers. The Russian threat is brutal, extremely serious, but we cannot forget other risks to our security. I am thinking of the Middle East crisis, to which insufficient attention has been paid in recent years, or the grave situation in the Sahel, which has direct repercussions on our borders. Finally, NATO is essential, but we Europeans must take increasing responsibility for our own defence and increase our capabilities. It seems clear that we cannot depend exclusively on the United States if, moreover, we don't know who will occupy the White House in a few months.\n",

We Poles have repeatedly experienced the effects of Russian imperialism throughout our history. We are constantly experiencing information warfare, as well as ruthless actions in the economic sphere. Only the European Union as a strong and effective community, but above all a defence community, only such a European Union is capable of repelling threats from the Kremlin regime. The Prime Minister of the Polish government, Donald Tusk, recently said that it is time for Europe's politicians and societies to wake up, because the world is shaking to its foundations. More than ever before, this awakening is needed today. We need a European community in the field of defence.

Now, with Russian war against Ukraine, we are lost in the crossroads of our fears. We rightly fear what will happen with our security if Russia will win in Ukraine. But at the same time, we fear that chaos will happen in Russia, if Russia will be defeated. We fear a long-term war in Ukraine; that we shall become tired of such a war. And we fear to give Ukraine enough weapons for the victory in the near future, because we are afraid that Putin will escalate. President Roosevelt once prudently said, ‘The only thing we have to fear is fear itself.’ Let us stop our fears and let us declare: Putin needs to be defeated and he will be defeated.

Yes, of course we must strengthen defense, but we must also fight for peace. This is what European citizens expect, and look, my country allocates 2.5% of its budget to defense, but, unfortunately, it is not treated the same as other states that allocate less to defense, and the best example is Austria. Romania is discriminated against both on farmers and on Schengen. We are talking about strengthening here: in order to be able to strengthen defense and to fight for peace, we need at least to set this as our goal.

The representative of the socialists says that the European Union should be a moral beacon, and this Parliament very gladly accepts that role, so we then explain to everyone in the world what they should be doing. But the question is, by what authority? We are demographically declining, economically stagnating, militarily we are ever weaker – and then we would invite everyone else to be like us? You must admit that you have pursued misguided social, economic, and migration policies. What we need is a strong Europe, a healthy society based on family, a healthy economy based on freedom – not on the socialist equality that the President of the Socialists advocates, and which has never brought economic progress.

If we have acted united in defending Ukraine against Putin's brutal aggression, we must do the same in the other corner of the Mediterranean, given the brutal disproportionality of the Israeli military offensive in Gaza.

Everyone in Europe wants united efforts to protect ourselves together. How can we do it, other than by allocating more money? First, building infrastructure that allows free movement of defence equipment. You don't imagine us defending ourselves while our defence equipment waits in traffic jams, as happens with lorries, do you? This cannot continue. We need to build shelters, a transport network that allows the free movement of people and goods in peacetime, but when it is necessary to defend ourselves – also of defence equipment.

We can’t have internal security with a socially divided EU that doesn’t prioritise the concerns and needs of its own citizens.

We must strengthen the European defence industry, but that is also not enough. We need to strengthen the borders of the European Union that border Putin's aggression.

I listened very carefully for two hours and noted that there is indeed broad consensus in this House among the political groups that we must further strengthen our Common Foreign and Security Policy, and our Common Security and Defence Policy, with the exception of the representatives of the far left and the far right extremes. As this report is the last of its kind that we will adopt in this parliamentary term, it could – and this would be my wish – serve, together with our colleague Mr. Mikser's report, as a guideline for the next Commission, for the President of the Commission, and also for the next High Representative and Vice-President of the Commission. One thing is clear in any case: We are experiencing a geopolitical paradigm shift. Therefore, it is all the more important – probably more important than ever before – that the European Union finally learns – as Jean-Claude Juncker once called it – 'Weltpolitikfähigkeit', or the ability to conduct world politics. As the European Union, we must finally live up to our foreign and security policy role in this world.

By offering enormous, free subsidies to arms multinationals, whose stock market performance has, nonetheless, been excellent since the war in Ukraine. This is a mistake. This policy will strengthen arms companies to the detriment of other businesses. Furthermore, some companies that could, for example, produce Canadair firefighting aircraft will be pushed to produce fighter jets. A militarisation of industry. Heading towards an economy at the service of war. This is not the Europe we need. Europe must not draw inspiration from the American imperialist model, which spends exorbitant sums to wage war across the globe. Firstly, we must rationalise expenditure. We already spend far more than other countries – consider Russia, India, or Brazil. On the one hand, we must focus on the strict defence of our territory.

The Russian aggressor does not intend to withdraw from Ukrainian territory nor cease its criminal aggression. It increasingly threatens countries bordering Ukraine, including Poland. It is our duty to be ready to defend our freedom, lives, and values. Therefore, Sweden's accession to NATO is a good decision, which should also serve as a signal to Ukraine, Georgia, and Moldova – NATO partner states and allies. Only by acting together, maintaining transatlantic cooperation, do we have a real chance to stop the imperialist, aggressive policy of Russia and Putin. Ukraine cannot be left alone in defending against Putin's henchmen. If he is not driven out of Ukraine, who knows where he will strike next?

The Union does not even try to resolve the latest chapter of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict. Why, despite such negative experiences, do we again dream of military independence, of strategic autonomy, the compass, etc.? The Russian-Ukrainian war should definitely convince us of the need for close transatlantic cooperation. Precisely now, when doubts are emerging across the ocean, we should present a credible offer of cooperation instead of autonomous, self-serving solutions. The disregard for facts is also concerning. In Europe, we do not have a common definition or a common list of threats. Therefore, we cannot have the same answers to different threats. Nor can the majority impose on others the means to counter threats. Together, we must take into account the diverse circumstances of various member states. Our Western friends should finally understand that our Eastern experiences and the security proposals based on them for Europe are realistic and practical. Let us prevent Russia from interfering in Europe, maintain the US presence, and temper the hegemonic aspirations of some member states.

      "\tMadam President, Mr Prime Minister, Mr Commissioner, first of all, in four months, you will have to deploy – we do not doubt the efficiency and speed of the Belgians. In a speech, there is obviously what is expressed and what is not expressed. I deeply regret that there was not a single word for agriculture, not a word for all those living in rural areas, in the most remote areas at the European level, and who are also awaiting signals from the Belgian Presidency. Look at what is happening in Germany, the anger of the farmers. I think it is important, when holding the presidency of the European Union, to also be able to reassure the entire European population and provide direction – the direction of protection. To protect all European citizens wherever they may be, whoever they may be, whatever their reality, and also to be able – in what is most important concerning protection: the European Union's strategy of autonomy, particularly in sectors as important as food – to send strong signals. I did not hear them, Mr Prime Minister, and I did not even hear the word 'agriculture' once in your presentation. It's the same in other sectors like health: there too, Europe must better protect its population and regain autonomy, or in key sectors like digital technology – admittedly, you mentioned it, but never with this vision of being much stronger, especially against Chinese interference. The same applies to other sectors such as defense; we must ensure much stronger coordination. Your predecessor, Mr Macron, had at least laid the groundwork for this European construction in terms of defense. So you will say that criticism is easy. That said, anger is great because with only a few months until the elections, I believe it is more than necessary to protect Europeans, to indeed give them this guarantee that Europe will be by their side to prevent them from turning, in terms of democracy, towards votes that might be extreme. Standing by rural areas and farmers means defending our food supply, and it also means defending the European Union.\n",

      "\tMadam President, Prime Minister De Croo, welcome to the European Parliament. Belgium is holding the rotating Presidency of the Council in times of uncertainty and great transformations, after the successful Spanish Presidency, led by President Pedro Sánchez, with the conclusion of historic agreements, as you rightly mentioned: the Migration and Asylum Pact, the reform of the electricity market, and the Nature Restoration Law. You now have the opportunity to lead the construction of a Union that is not only more competitive but also has greater social justice. The Belgian Presidency cannot be a transitional Presidency. On the eve of the upcoming European elections, our citizens need more progress to ensure advancement. If you commit to building a Union with more soul, with that soul that Jacques Delors asked for, you can count on the support of the social democratic family, because we can only provide solutions to the real problems of our citizens with more Europe. And Europe is built with a social pillar that guarantees fair wages, minimum incomes, remunerated policies and practices, and dignified housing. Mr. De Croo, respect the agreement reached with Parliament to approve the Platform Workers Directive, because improving the working conditions of twenty-eight million people cannot wait any longer. Europe is built with more equality, and no victory will be more important than building a society where gender violence is eradicated. Europe is built with more individual rights, in a Union where LGTBI people can love freely. Europe is built with a Union leading the fight against climate change, because progress, if it is not sustainable, cannot be called progress. Mr. De Croo, combating the climate emergency requires courage and leadership: courage and leadership to meet our emission reduction commitments of the Green Deal, and courage and leadership to approve the Air Quality Directive and save the lives of 300,000 people who prematurely lose them each year. This is not a figure that we invent from the social democratic group; it is a figure corroborated by the medical and scientific community. And I am glad to hear the representative of the European People's Party speak of health: I understand that this means that the EPP Group will also support the Air Quality Directive. Europe is built with an open strategic autonomy. It is built with a more human digital transformation, now that we are the first power in the world to approve the Artificial Intelligence Act. Europe is also built by turning our Union into an exporting power of peace, because we cannot show indifference to the suffering of other peoples. That is why we need to conclude the review of the multiannual financial framework with an essential revision to continue supporting Ukraine, because European solidarity cannot give way to Orbán's vetoes or the fatigue of a war that the criminal Putin will prolong over time. And we must show the same unity and firmness to lead a peace conference in the Middle East that puts an end to the crimes of Hamas and the Netanyahu Government and makes the two-state solution possible, as you rightly mentioned. Mr. De Croo, we need a European project that inspires our citizens; a European project that does not succumb to the denialism, fear, and hatred of the right and the far-right. Do not make the historical mistake in the liberal family that conservatives made by allowing yourselves to be dragged by the far-right, the greatest threat to our democracy and to the European project. Let us have the courage to respond to the challenges we face with a fairer Europe, so that, looking back at the end of the Belgian Presidency, we can say at this crucial moment in history that we built a better Europe. Madam President, Commissioner, Prime Minister Alexander, Minister, good morning. My best wishes, also here in Strasbourg. Prime Minister, this is the thirteenth time our country has held the presidency. And we Belgians love that. Why? It gives us a moment to show what we are good at. We can once again demonstrate our proverbial art of compromise, as you just did, and I think we all followed it, on your trip to China. That art of compromise, that leadership, will be necessary, because we only have a few weeks before those crucial European elections to finalize legislation for our security and to establish a European defence and, as far as I am concerned, that European army, for the migration pact, to manage our migration flows, and also to develop that necessary European industrial plan. Urgently needed for the strengthening of our industry and our companies. We must remain competitive, and I would be very happy if we could credit this to a liberal prime minister. But for me, colleagues, the most important thing at stake during this Belgian presidency is the reform of the Union. I hope, Alexander, that you will find inspiration there. In 2001, a Belgian presidency was led by another liberal prime minister, well-known to you. At that time, a convention was launched that led to a reform of the Union, to the Treaty of Lisbon. I hope you find inspiration there, because I don't know if anyone here still doubts that we need to reform the Union. We are threatened from within, by the Orbáns of this world, and threatened from outside. We must reform the Union now, and certainly with that necessary enlargement of the Union that is high on the agenda, for our security. But we in Renew Europe say very clearly: no enlargement without deepening. The Union must be reformed. And what does that mean for us? Abolishing unanimity, a real EU Foreign Minister as far as I'm concerned, and also focusing on that European army. Prime Minister De Croo, I know you, and just as you lead a government in Belgium, I am sure that you will also bring this presidency to a successful conclusion with calm but confident leadership and that it will be a success. You know, when the wind is against us and it's uphill, we Flandriens are the very best. So I would say: crack the whip, let's move forward. You already have our support.\n",

      "\tMadam President, Mr Prime Minister, welcome to this assembly. I have absolutely no doubt, and I believe no one here does, that Belgium is capable, for the third time, of brilliantly taking on the presidency of the Union. I would like to start with a word of tribute to you personally and to your approach to politics. Often, including in our country, political debate degenerates into a kind of cockfight where ideas and projects no longer hold any importance. Your manner, which combines the dignity of office and nuance with respect for the human person, are, for me, qualities that every political leader should display, and you do. You are capable of leading by example, and for that, I thank you. That does not mean we agree on everything, however. And if there is one occasion when you shocked me, it was the day you used the word 'pause' regarding the ecological transition, the European Green Deal. That Manfred Weber, a conservative, speaks of a moratorium, I understand. That Emmanuel Macron, who is green until it affects the interests of his electoral base, i.e., the rentiers, uses the word 'pause', fine. But not you, not you of all people. You know, when the house is burning – and this is the environmentalist speaking – when the house is burning, you don't ask firefighters to take a break until the fire is extinguished. And I would also say, given our shared past in the private sector, that when Europe is engaged in a competitiveness marathon against the United States and China in the green revolution, we cannot afford a pause. On the contrary, we must accelerate. Of course, when you start running, your joints ache a little. But I think our societies are ready for the effort, provided that the effort is distributed fairly among them; that is absolutely crucial. The last point I would like to raise is the question of failure. Indeed, there is one subject on which I wish you, I wish us collectively, failure: that is the European Union's budgetary rules. At a time when, more than ever, we need a strategic European Union, a European Union that invests, we are preparing – when I read the Council's text and Parliament's text – we are preparing to truly undermine, to sacrifice both our social cohesion, our future economic prosperity, and, I would say, our geopolitical sovereignty by forcing ourselves to cut off our arms, legs, and wings at the very moment when the European Union will have to take flight, perhaps without the protection of the United States, as has been the case since the Second World War. I believe that the adoption of such rules would be a form of suicide for the European Union, and therefore, on that matter, I collectively wish us failure.\n",
      "\tGood morning, President, colleagues. Mr Prime Minister, you are now also advocating for an industrial deal. You are calling for the strengthening of our competitiveness. You have apparently listened very carefully to what the N-VA has been proposing for years. But you are not acting on it, Mr Prime Minister, and I hope that the EU will have a better policy than your disastrous Belgian policy. The top priority must be to complete our internal market. This yields 12% growth. But you allowed the very worst to happen. You allowed the internal market to fragment. The level playing field for state aid has been abolished to the detriment of the economies of small Member States, to the detriment of our growth and our prosperity. On top of that, large Member States in their retail sector only allow products from their own country, again to the detriment of our economy, our jobs, our prosperity. And entirely in line with your liberal vision, you advocate for more EU taxes. The EU does not need more resources. The EU needs fundamental reforms. There must be a budgetary shift towards more resources for innovation, for infrastructure, for the green and digital transition, for security, for migration policy. Open strategic autonomy must be the answer to progressing deglobalisation. But it is precisely your government that is blocking new trade agreements, which are a means to achieve this. Moreover, you are cooperating in a deluge of new regulations. The EU constantly produces new rules, and this strangles our competitiveness. Permits must be granted much faster, not only to cleantech and chip technology but to all companies, to all governments. Finally: our security has long been threatened again. You must make it a top priority to arrange more resources and more weapons to support Ukraine. There is a lot of work to be done. We will follow your presidency closely and very critically.\n",
      "\tPresident, colleagues, I have not come here today to apologise for the behaviour of today's absentee, Charles Michel, who not only shames Belgium but also the European institutions themselves. Someone else will just have to do it. For those who are critical of European cooperation and a European Union that is evolving into a centralised unitary state to the detriment of the competences of the Member States, for someone who takes 'our people first' as the starting point for his political actions, Belgium's presidency is not good news.

The Belgian establishment is not only a blind follower of this agenda, but the Belgian government is also, like the majority in this European Parliament, a hodgepodge that in fact lacks a real democratic majority in the Belgian parliament. To circumvent a clear right-wing, Flemish-national election victory in Flanders, a government was cobbled together, dominated by left-wing MEPs primarily elected in the French-speaking part of the country. At its head is a Flemish Prime Minister from one of the smallest parties in that coalition. This position makes him a so-called 'doormat' for the Walloon Parti Socialiste. A damned rag, not according to Nigel Farage's word that he once used here for Herman Van Rompuy's image, but according to Alexander De Croo's literal own word in an interview, a few months before he would take on that 'doormat' status himself. Colleagues, the consequences of these political imbalances are not absent. Belgium is, not according to my figures, but according to the European Commission's Semester Assessment, itself a serious problem. The budget deficit is, apart from Slovakia's, the worst in the entire European Union, both this year and beyond, when the situation will further deteriorate to approximately 5%. The overall debt-to-GDP ratio threatens to rise to 107.3% in 2025, and unlike the rest of the entire European Union, again with the exception of Slovakia, inflation in Belgium in 2024 will rise to 4.2%. That Belgium finds itself in such an exceptional and, in fact, scandalous situation is less puzzling than it seems. Those who dare to look at the facts can see that all French-speaking, or French-socialist-dominated institutions, are heading for a financial catastrophe in 2024. French-speaking Belgium is consequently no longer able to contribute to a normalisation of the country. On the Flemish side, this normalisation is increasingly considered simply impossible by more and more people, and they desire either partial or full autonomy for Flanders. For Belgium, therefore, rather than today's presidency chair, a penalty bench would be more appropriate after the 2024 elections.\n",

      "\tMadam President, Mr. Prime Minister, apparently we need to speed things up a bit, because you still have to go to Davos. I know very well that this isn't the reality for the millionaires there. You will still take the time to listen to us for five minutes, because the reality of millionaires in Davos is obviously not the reality of the working class in Europe today. Your government is taking the lead in a Europe facing a catastrophic social situation. Wages are no longer enough. People are afraid of grocery prices, afraid to turn up the heating even when it's cold like today. And it is indeed extremely striking that, in this context, you dare not, in your speech, acknowledge one of the central priorities of this Belgian Presidency: the return of budgetary rules, which you remain silent about, which is present in the document, in the plan, but here, in your speech, you hide the return of European austerity laws. What does this mean? It means budget cuts in hospitals, in schools, in nurseries and even – you know, in 2023, the European Commission already complained about wage indexation in Belgium – even our wages risk being attacked by this mechanism. So, do you really want to be the government, Mr. De Croo, that will bring back this straitjacket and put a noose around the neck of working people all over Europe? We must not bring back this straitjacket, we must bury it, and as President, sabotage these negotiations, stop these negotiations on the fiscal pact. Rather than cutting our wages, our services, Mr. De Croo, read yesterday's Oxfam report. Multinationals all over the world, including in Europe, are making excess profits. Their profits are set to shatter all records in 2023. In Belgium, by the way, your country and mine, the richest 1% own as much as 70% of the population. And yet no ambitious initiative for fairer taxation in your program. None. Please, have a minimum of ambition. Tax millionaires, large multinationals or financial transactions. Are you afraid to do it because afterwards, I don't know, Bill Gates won't stop by the Belgian pavilion in Davos later? Frankly, this is not the Europe workers need. It's true, Mr. De Croo. Now that Belgium is President of the European Union, what are the priorities then? Austerity? Are we going to cut back again on things working people need? That can't be right! Stop that! As President, you can say: \"No, this Europe will no longer save. These budgetary rules, we don't want them, and we will stretch out, delay, or at least not make these meetings a priority.\" That is Belgium's responsibility, because saving EUR 5 billion per year over the coming years would be a disaster for Belgium and for the rest of Europe. Because what signal are you sending to working people with that? People who no longer have a bus? Who no longer have a station? People who are afraid to turn on their heating? Look at Oxfam, listen to Oxfam, and get the money where it is. Set up an ambitious, fair tax program or at least take a small initiative. That must be possible for you. Finally, in your document, you promise not to leave Russian war crimes in Ukraine unpunished. Good, but not a single word about Israel's war crimes. Why? Why are you giving Netanyahu a free pass?\n",

When I speak about responding to crises, we are seeing many farmers being concerned, being out in the streets in many Member States of the European Union. Prime Minister De Croo, we expect the Belgian Council Presidency to react to this, to put the concerns of the farmers on the agenda of the Council as a matter of priority. When it comes to further developing the Union, I think the Belgian Presidency has identified some correct priorities for the European Union, and I would like to encourage you to work a lot on further strengthening the competitiveness of the European economy. We started to do some good work with the Swedish Presidency on this topic. Improving the competitiveness of our economy means the economy can grow. We can create more jobs. We can secure the payments of salaries, of pensions, of social benefits. This is the core of what Europe is. So please work on competitiveness. Please be fast on revising the Multiannual Financial Framework at all levels in the Council. This needs to be done. Please count on the European Parliament.

For us, it is clear: it will be about a Europe that protects, that strengthens prosperity, and that defends freedom, democracy, and human rights. That Europe must and will be social. That is why the discussion on the revision of the budgetary rules, the so-called economic governance, is so crucial. There can be no question of returning to a policy of austerity, austerity, and austerity. Mr. Botenga, you are misinformed. If there is one Member State that strongly adheres to the position we have adopted in the European Parliament, namely room for investments, including social investments, public services, and a sustainable transition, then it is Belgium. And there is a very important task for you, Mr. Prime Minister, to transform the Council's abysmal position into a better one. My colleague Lamberts has already referred to this: in this transition, there can be no question of a pause button, Mr. Prime Minister, that was somewhat of a faux pas. It is, moreover, a false choice. It's not about either nature, or farmers, or an ambitious climate policy, or our industry. They go hand in hand. What is important, however, is that in Europe we actually do not yet have the public resources. A kind of European investment fund to level the playing field for all Member States and to ensure two important things: a truly industrial policy that keeps industry in Europe; and to ensure that everyone is included in this transition, including those who today lack the means to renovate their homes or buy an electric car. We must also ensure better public transport for that. Last point – very important, our responsibility: geopolitics. Ukraine. To stand as one – as one man or one woman – behind Ukraine and fulfill our promises. Mr. Prime Minister, it will be very important to demonstrate that same courage and that same unity when it comes to the conflict between Israel and Hamas. And I know that the Belgian position in that area is sound. Let us ensure that an immediate ceasefire and access to much more humanitarian aid become an absolute spearhead of this Belgian Presidency.

In a few months, our American allies may revert to isolationism and show animosity towards us. But in a few months, Ukraine may not yet have regained its territorial integrity, and I refuse to embrace the idea that we must wait, again and again, for the worst to happen before finally acting.

UN asylum rules make 780 million people eligible for asylum. Prime Minister De Croo, the universal right to asylum is a threat to the future of Europe.

I believe it is important to set the right priorities. And for me, two things are fundamental: One is the fight against irregular migration. I believe the most important thing is that the Migration Pact, which was deliberated in December last year, is concluded. And I ask you to truly do everything in your power to ensure that this package can actually enter into force, and in parallel to do everything possible to conclude agreements with third countries so that rejected migrants who are not entitled to stay can also be returned. The second important topic is to support and strengthen competitiveness in the European Union. You said that Europe is actually well-positioned; we have the single market, we have the Euro, our own currency, we have healthy, medium-sized businesses with high innovative strength. But, dear colleagues, you know it, everyone suffers from bureaucracy, from excessive regulation. And for me, that is the most important thing: rather do less in this area, do not introduce new proposals, requirements, reporting obligations. Less is more. We must relieve the burden on our medium-sized businesses. This also applies to agriculture, which suffers equally from high requirements and burdens.

I ask you to keep building consensus in the Council for this fair request, and bring it back to its agenda as soon as possible. There can be no legitimate reason to keep denying us Catalans, but also Galicians and Basques the same linguistic rights towards the EU than the vast majority of EU citizens already enjoy. Prime Minister, millions of Catalans count on your commitment towards diversity and equality of rights to deliver on this important issue.\n",

Farmers and transport workers are openly expressing their views on the implementation of, among other things, climate goals, the Green Deal, and emission levels, which are supposedly to be achieved in the coming years. Do you also intend to call these masses of EU citizens populists, backward obscurantists who do not understand that achieving goals, for example, the \"Fit for 55\" package, is the only chance to save the EU economy, agriculture, and natural environment? Listen to what these people are saying, and observe the scale of the protests. And in my opinion, this is only a prelude to what we can expect in the near future. People have taken to the streets in Germany, Paris, the Netherlands, and this is just the beginning. This is because people are losing their jobs. Despite the incantations of this liberal-left majority, so often detached from reality in this parliament, farmers – who know the real hardship of work – are starting to speak their minds about being forced to achieve so many unrealistic goals. It is also extremely important that the leaders gathering within the European Council remember what the rule of law is. Mainly because in Poland, after October 13th, ministers and the prime minister decide at their own discretion what is lawful and what is not, regardless of what the Polish constitution says about it.\n",

Europe is thus acting and moving forward. At the same time, unfortunately, there are Member States that are working to undermine and break cooperation. The Hungarian government is one such example. Therefore, as an opposition MEP from Hungary, I consider it my duty to draw the attention of the Belgian Presidency to treating the preservation of European values, the strengthening of democracy, and the monitoring of their implementation as a top priority.

      "\tMr. President, Mr. Vice-President, national parliaments are fundamental actors in European democracy and national democracy, and therefore, their capacity for action can always be improved, especially at the European level. And here, we know that, on subsidiarity issues, they can exercise greater control over the European policy of their national governments. Indeed, these were the conclusions of the Conference on the Future of Europe: the capacity of national parliaments to scrutinise, control, and guide the European policy of their national governments. And that is why a new idea is introduced in this report concerning the implementation of the activity of national parliaments and their role in the European Union, which is to provide greater transparency to the Council. If we are able to reveal the votes in the Council, this will allow each national parliament, in its own country, to exercise much more precise control over its government's position and whether it corresponds to the policy it committed to and the commitments it made before that parliament. Therefore, the European mandate received by national governments can only be scrutinised by national parliaments if voting in the Council is public. We also know why national parliaments are now relevant institutions at the European level – it is not to represent their States, for that, governments are already in the Council. National parliaments represent the political diversity within each State. A minority in one State can be a majority in another State. And, therefore, what truly justifies a European status for national parliaments is not the representation of States – because that is done in the Council – it is the representation of the political diversity of each State, which corresponds to political positions that have a different projection in different States. Finally, let me say that we continue to insist that the eight-week deadline for the early warning mechanism is not sufficient. We continue, obviously, to believe that the principle of subsidiarity – taking into account the criteria of the Treaties, the jurisprudence of the court, the Commission's own practice – implies greater clarity and that some gaps in its interpretations can be filled. Finally, let me say that we do not endorse the idea of the Green Card here. National parliaments do not have European legislative initiative, nor can they. They cannot be a third chamber at the level of the European Union. On the contrary, they need to strengthen the national scrutiny of their governments' European policy. And, therefore, to that extent, we can, at most, accept that a certain number of parliaments can address a suggestion to the Commission and that the Commission, if it gathers a certain number of parliaments, has an obligation to respond. Allow me, finally, to just mention a long-standing idea – one I have put forward many times here in the past regarding this report or these reports – which is the creation of a European week. We should have a week that, in all national parliaments, would be a week for debating European affairs, with the presence of MEPs not only from that country and with the presence of Commissioners. This would be a way to create a week in which European topics would be debated at a national level, in all parliaments. This suggestion is once again put forward.

It is therefore a milestone today, and an intellectual and political challenge. Because the world has changed, extraordinarily so. So it is time to reflect on the present and future of this European citizenship, because we have experienced these transformations. What do I say... is it an added value? Absolutely, yes. Are changes and improvements needed to continue maximising that value? In a geopolitically turbulent world, I believe so.\n",

We propose the creation or updating of certain rights in order to achieve gender-balanced democratic representation on electoral lists, a permanent interactive digital platform to foster citizens' participation in the life of the Union, and to enjoy recognition of study periods for working in the Union. In the digital sphere, we consider it essential to recognise universal access to the internet, grant a digital identity to each user, regulate their digital inheritance, and clarify the citizen's relationship with artificial intelligence tools.\n",

In addition to more concrete policies, it is important to me to include everyone. With a view to the European elections, the young generation is particularly important to me. To reach them better, I expect an investment in the new generation. Specifically, this means: make more intensive use of social media, talk more about Europe using new digital instruments, and foster genuine political exchange about our common values. The latest Eurobarometer survey shows that citizens are very well aware of their European rights, such as the freedom of movement. At the same time, there is no awareness of common citizenship and belonging when they go to the polls for the European elections. The upcoming European elections in June are an immediate and concrete challenge. How many citizens will actually go to vote?

This is particularly true in cross-border regions, especially when they are united on both sides of a border by the same language.

The report on national parliaments puts forward excessive and detrimental proposals and is written from this centralist perspective, emphasising creating a European political sphere revolving around European political families, interfering in the affairs of the Member States. It does not adequately treat national parliaments as fully-fledged European political actors. It portrays them as secondary political actors subordinate to the European Parliament. It flatly rejects the red card procedure to repeal EU laws, as proposed during the works on the Treaty change by the European Conservatives and Reformers Group. This report advocates direct engagement of European political parties in campaigns, in campaigns for European elections and in referenda in Member States, thus neglecting the diversity and autonomy of the national political scenes. The ECR will vote against this report. The second report concerning EU citizenship is even more controversial, as it proposes to strip the Member States of their most fundamental and exclusive prerogatives. Let me remind you that EU citizenship is, according to the EU Treaties, closely linked and dependent on the nationality of Member States, and granting citizenship is an exclusive competence of Member States. There is – and should never be – no other way to obtain EU citizenship than by obtaining the nationality of a Member State and citizenship of a Member State, according to rules which are specific to each Member State and take into account their traditions and constitutional order. Granting EU citizenship to third country nationals without them obtaining citizenship of a Member State would go against the Treaty order. The ECR will vote against the second report also.\n",

Their thresholds should be lowered to one quarter and one third, respectively, for the system to become viable. Two: create a red card procedure to allow a majority of national parliaments to repeal a European directive or regulation they do not want. Three: strengthen interparliamentary meetings to allow national parliaments to coordinate and exert more influence over the European Parliament, which too often tends to legislate in the isolation of its Brussels fortress.

In recent decades, as you have mentioned, we have faced numerous challenges. The first of these was the building of European citizenship, which has been present since the very inception of what is today the Union and which has been consolidated over the decades thanks to the efforts of all. Thirty years after the Maastricht Treaty, I believe we can say that, thanks to iconic programmes like Erasmus, there is no doubt that Europeans feel themselves citizens of this Union: nine out of ten Spaniards do so, and three out of four would like more decisions to be taken at European level. Another key challenge in this horizon of prosperity was to cross the bridge from one century to another, and that implies making the digital transition. If European citizenship is characterised by the bond between the citizen and the Union, materialised in rights, obligations and the political participation of citizens, none of these issues can be addressed independently of technology, but neither can technology leave anyone behind. This current reality means that our lives unfold simultaneously in the virtual world and the physical world, and we must therefore be able to incorporate it into the framework of all that we have built over these decades: all the rights, obligations and also political participation. We must take all of this into account, honourable Members, because Europe, either it stands with young people, or it will cease to be; either it stands with families, or it will cease to be; Europe, either it stands with its citizens, or it will cease to be.\n",

These reports address two issues of great importance to all of us. On the one hand, the relationship with national parliaments. We too are parliamentarians, and there have always been attempts to pit national parliaments against the European Parliament, but this report demonstrates that this is not the case. On the contrary, what we are promoting is an alliance between national parliaments and the European Parliament, because that is the common interest: to promote the participation of national parliamentarians in building Europe. The idea of extending the deadline to twelve weeks so that they can more effectively carry out —dear Ms Bresso, the socialist shadow rapporteur— that scrutiny of subsidiarity and also, on the other hand, from the other report —a very good proposal which we also support, Pascal Durand, the socialist rapporteur— to build, dear Ms Pagazaurtundúa, that Statute of European Citizenship, bringing together all rights —those of the Charter, those of the Treaty— into a single instrument. I believe due note should be taken of these two ideas, also by the Belgian Presidency, which, by the way, I also encourage to promote that, before the European elections, the European Council can debate the European Parliament's proposal for Treaty reform.\n",

This Member State is often forgotten, neglected, left behind. This should mobilize all of us, but in fact, nothing is done. Yes, dear colleagues, I am speaking of over 13 million European citizens, over 13 million, who live in another Member State and are not informed about their right to vote and stand as a candidate in local and European Parliament elections, everywhere in Europe, regardless of their nationality. They live Europe every day and, paradoxically, it is often made too difficult for them to exercise the first right they have, that of voting for local democracy and European democracy.

National parliamentarians do not have the right to hand over sovereignty without asking for an explicit mandate from the people. The Conference on the Future of Europe was a sham and a scam. Giving the European institutions more power because some randomly selected citizens, guided by federalist MEPs, said they want it, is not how democracy works. We should trust the peoples.

Professor Raffelhüschen, Germany's best-known pension expert, disagrees: Migration as it has been so far will cost Germany economically at least 5.8 trillion Euros, far more than Germany's economic output in one year. This sum results from integration and social welfare costs and the difference between migrants' fiscal contributions and the benefits they receive. Conclusion: Even the smartest migration policy is unaffordable. Raffelhüschen, in his own words: \"If we continue as we have been, we are as stupid as a post.\" Europe needs an immediate asylum stop, limited access to the social system only for nationals, and comprehensive remigration. The French Parliament recently made a good start. The new migration law makes naturalisation more difficult and facilitates the deportation of seriously criminal and illegal migrants. The EU Parliament now wants to withdraw this sovereign right from the Member States, through the harmonisation of national naturalisation law. Von der Leyen's and Johansson's mass migration is thus to be made irreversible. Whoever brings Calcutta here does not help Calcutta but becomes Calcutta themselves.

It is clear that all citizens in the Member States must enjoy all rights and be treated equally, wherever they may be in the European Union. We must ensure that documents and qualifications are fully recognized, that social rights and benefits can be easily transferred, including pensions and child allowances, that there are no longer differences in treatment, and that intra-European mobility is complete. Whether Romanians, Italians or Swedes, we are all Europeans, and this implies knowing our rights, as well as how the European Union functions.

They have the final say on Member States' contributions to the Union's budget. National parliaments ratify directives and have oversight power over the national executive involved in the European legislative process. Furthermore, if they wish, they are involved in the scrutiny of subsidiarity and proportionality, not to mention their role in providing political impetus. To this end, the idea of a European Week allowing European decision-makers to discuss the European agenda with national parliamentarians seems to me to be eminently sensible. As is the proposal to increase the time reserved for national parliaments to scrutinize legislative proposals for their compliance with the principles of subsidiarity and proportionality from 8 to 12 weeks. I am deeply convinced that any Member of the European Parliament who continually informs themselves of the priorities and positions of national parliamentarians, and any national parliamentarian who informs themselves of the work being done at the European level, are and will remain indispensable. As for the European Parliament, we would do well to rethink how we interact with our national parliamentary colleagues. Very often, these meetings, which regularly take place in Brussels, are rather disappointing because they essentially turn into a series of monologues. The more people there are, the more monologues there are, and the less interaction there is among participants. It would be a great pity to continue this practice indefinitely.\n",

It is somewhat unfortunate that such important topics, which are not entirely related, are condensed into a single debate. Therefore, I will at least address the first topic, which is the role of national parliaments. I consider it extremely important. I have always perceived it this way, even when I served in the Czech Parliament and later at the Ministry of Justice. And we should truly analyze how genuinely important the role of national parliaments is in the legislative process of adopting European legislation, and to what extent national parliaments' opinions truly influence the final form of European legislation. And I see this from my country's experience as well, that quite simply, the 8-week deadline for reasoned opinions from national parliaments on proposed European legislation is an exceptionally short timeframe. It is clear that we probably won't change it, because it is set by primary legislation. On the other hand, for quite some time, there has been consideration here about a possible interpretation of this deadline, where it might be possible to achieve a more lenient approach to it. Unfortunately, those proposals are currently only on the table, and the Commission has not yet taken a position on them. I believe that the deadline truly is something that, from my perspective, significantly influences whether national parliaments seriously engage with the proposed European legislation or not. Unfortunately, time is limited in this way, but we should further debate the topic of national parliaments' opinions in the future, because I believe there is still much room for improvement there.

We need to further enhance the role of national parliaments in their primary function of scrutinising the governments that sit around the Council table, but also in the European political dynamic itself. And we also need to do better in recognising and strengthening citizenship rights, by publicising these rights, removing obstacles to their exercise, and promoting a more participatory European democracy. In a European election year, we must remember that the most important political right of European citizens is the right to vote. And to combat abstention, we must educate people about the importance of European elections, inform mobile citizens about their right to vote, and facilitate the exercise of the right to vote for everyone.

This is a report which, furthermore, aims to eliminate golden visas and golden passports, the abuse of which undermines the principle of European citizenship, and to teach European culture and history so as not to repeat the mistakes of the past —because the lessons are conclusive— and which also allows for the generation of a sense of belonging and inclusion for all European citizens in this great project that we share.

The first point is this: the main function of national parliaments is to scrutinise national governments, and this is a European function. And that is why I say it is essential that we advance in the transparency of votes in the Council. A parliament can only verify whether its government is following the parliament's guidelines or what positions it is defending in the European Union if it knows how that government voted in each Council formation. And therefore, this would be a very, very simple way to empower national parliaments, precisely by enabling them to fulfil their main mission. Next, several colleagues here spoke about the green card and especially the red card. I must say that, after consulting all parliaments, none wanted the red card – not for this report, but for a previous one. Second point: green card, I repeat – not even the European Parliament has legislative initiative, and therefore, legislative initiative cannot be given to national parliaments, nor can they be transformed into a third chamber. So, that does not make sense. National parliaments, once again I say, truly have their main role at the national level. And then, yes, increasing interparliamentary dialogue – I fully agree. Increasing it, however, with one caveat: that the representations of national parliaments must be diverse; that is, they must include members from both the majority and the opposition. And in the reports that national parliaments present and in their opinions, the declarations of vote from minorities should always also be included, because the great advantage of national parliaments' participation at the European level is to bring internal diversity, since the national position is already brought by the governments. Therefore, it is this internal diversity that should be brought to the European level. This can only be done through adequate representation of national parliaments.\n",

The campaign against Boko Haram has had some success under President Buhari. However, attacks persist and there is still a lack of understanding about the group’s underlying support base and where it gets its funding from. Corruption remains, of course, one of the biggest challenges for Nigeria, placed 136 out of 175 countries in the Transparency International index. Buhari’s government needs to do far more to investigate and prosecute those guilty of corruption. None of the challenges facing Nigeria are easy to overcome.

If we look for conflict resolution, we must recognize that we are dealing with a climate problem, a problem between two lifestyles, a scarcity problem. Another topic that the Greens draw attention to when it comes to human rights, conflicts and Nigeria is the situation in the Niger Delta. The role of oil and oil multinationals in Nigeria, in collaboration with a corrupt government, continues to further destabilize the country.

In addition, at the moment there is a conflict between farmers and nomads, because, in essence, there is an attempt to grab the land. Therefore, these conflicts are simultaneously combined with religious conflicts. There is a persecution of the 30 million Christians of northern Nigeria. There is the terrorist activity of the Boko Haram organization, but it is able to carry out terrorist activity today because the very corruption of the regime is \"fertilizer\" for its growth.

This conflict has intensified in recent decades as a result of population growth, climate change and related drought waves, and the progressive desertification of northern Nigeria, and recently also as a result of the activity of the Boko Haram terrorist group. These factors are forcing predominantly Muslim pastoral peoples to move southwards, bringing them into conflict with mainly Christian settled agricultural ethnic groups. Christians, who have lived in these areas for centuries, have to deal with the aggression of immigrant groups looking for areas to graze cattle. As a result of the accompanying clashes, last year alone more than 1,500 people were killed and 100,000 were displaced. I appeal to the President of Nigeria, Mr. Muhammadu Buhari, to fulfill his declarations and take decisive steps for stabilization in central Nigeria, as well as intensify actions against Boko Haram in the north. It is crucial to create economic opportunities for pastoral groups without access to pastures, as well as to accelerate work on the regional Great Green Wall project to limit the ongoing desertification of the northern part of the country. These actions will address the causes of conflict in both the short and long term.\n",

Attempts to establish a permanent peace record only partial and short-term successes. The situation is worsened by political instability in the surrounding countries, especially in Syria. The EU is among Israel's largest trading partners and is also the largest provider of aid to Palestine. It is precisely this position that the EU must use more intensively and purposefully in the process of peacefully solving the problems of the Middle East.
