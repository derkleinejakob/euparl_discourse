\begin{abstract}

European politics of the past decade has been shaped by the rise of right-wing populism and the increasing politicisation of immigration. Using topic modeling and semantic embeddings, we analyze migration debates in the European Parliament (EP) from 2014 to 2024. Far-right parties disproportionately introduce migration into non-migration debates. 
Semantic analyses reveal stable rhetorical differences in far-right speech and a stronger alignment with established anti-immigration narratives. These results provide quantitative evidence that the populist right employs a distinct style of migration rhetoric.
