We use the ParlLawSpeech dataset \citep{SDN-10.7802-2824}, which contains the full verbatim transcriptions of parliamentary debates between 1999 and 2024 with rich metadata. We restrict the analyses to last two complete legislative periods (2014–2024), as the 2015/2016 “refugee crisis” could mark a qualitative shift in migration debates that might bias topic-model estimation. In a preliminary test, evidence for this effect was reflected by an increase in migration-labeled speeches from $\approx1\%$ before 2014 to over $2.5\%$ thereafter.

To contextualize and validate our findings around rhetorical patterns with an external benchmark, we use party positions from the Chapel Hill Expert Survey (CHES; \citealp{rovny_CHES_2024}), which provides repeated cross-sectional ratings of party ideology (e.g.\ left-right spectrum) and policy positions (e.g.\ on immigration) using standardized scales. CHES items were rescaled to a common 0–10 metric where necessary, following \citet{adams2014voters}.
National party affiliations were taken from the EP’s Open Data Portal for dataset merging. CHES ratings from 2014, 2019, and 2024 were used for correlations with semantic speech measures.

In 2015 and 2016, the total number of speeches increases sharply (over 50,000), compared to an average of $10,098 \pm 2,724$  in other years. %, reflecting a shift from numerous, shorter to fewer and longer speeches over time.
This phenomenon is largely explained by changes in parliamentary procedure adopted at the end of 2016 \citep{tremblay2024open}, most notably the discontinuation of short written statements. %Their removal largely normalizes annual speech counts.
