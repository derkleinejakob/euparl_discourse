The speeches often include bracketed comments that contain markers of the original language, parliamentary incidents, or procedural notes. We removed these comments using rule-based methods. There are also substantial redundencies in the openning and closing sections of the speeches (greetings, etc.). These sections follow similar rhetorical structures but exhibit substantial lexical variation. To remove redundant formalities, we identified low-impact sentences using TF-IDF which scores the amount of information of a sentence \citep{jones_statistical_1972}.
Two independent raters annotated 100 sampled low-scoring sentences for informational relevance. With these ratings we fit a logistic regression model to estimate the threshold required for 95\% classification accuracy. For each speech, first and last sentences were removed if their TF-IDF score was below this threshold.

Due to the fragmentation of right-wing forces in the EP and realignment across legislative terms, parliamentary groups were sorted into six ideological blocs following \citet{kaiser_seventy_2023}, see \Cref{fig:fig1_lda}.


% We detect high amount of superfluous commentary in transliterated speeches:  markers of the original language, background incidents, and procedural notes. These markers might be source of unwanted bias, which we want to avoid. Fortunately they are predominantly located within parentheses and can be easily removed with rule-based methods. We also observe substantial redundency in the openning and closing sections of the speeches.

% We construct separate corpora for opening and closing sentences, and an average TF-IDF score is computed for each sentence. Two independent raters annotated a sample of 100 low-scoring sentences for informational relevance. We then fit a logistic regression linking TF–IDF score percentiles to these annotations and used the model to estimate the threshold required to achieve 95\% classification accuracy.
