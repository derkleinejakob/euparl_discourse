The speeches include bracketed comments that contain markers of the original language, parliamentary incidents, or procedural notes. We removed these comments using rule-based methods. There are also substantial redundancies at the start and end of speeches (greetings, etc.). These sections follow similar rhetorical structures but exhibit substantial lexical variation. To remove redundant formalities, we identified low-impact sentences using TF-IDF, which scores the amount of information of a sentence \citep{sparck_jones_statistical_1972}.
Two raters annotated 100 sampled low-scoring sentences for informational relevance. With these ratings, we fit a logistic regression model to estimate the threshold required for 95\% accuracy. For each speech, the first and last sentences were removed if their TF-IDF score was below this threshold.

Due to the fragmentation of right-wing forces in the EP and realignment across legislative terms, parliamentary groups were sorted into six ideological blocs following \citet{kaiser_seventy_2023}, see \Cref{fig:fig1_lda}.
