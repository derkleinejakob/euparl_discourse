We use English translations to control for potential biases introduced by embeddings of different languages. 
Official translations were provided until 2012, which were extended with machine translations by Parllaw until 2019 \citep{rauh_documentation_2023}. We filled in the remaining translations using \emph{Gemini 2.5-flash} \citep{gemini_2025} and tested its translations on a random sample of speeches that had been translated by Parllaw. We checked that it (i) preserves speeches which are in English and (ii) creates translations with embeddings close to Parllaw's (lower $0.95$ bootstrap CI bound of mean cosine similarity: $0.969$; $n=1001$). %Thus, we asummed the difference in translation sources to be negligible.
