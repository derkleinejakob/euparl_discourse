We use English translations to control for potential biases introduced by using speeches of different languages. 
The European Parliament provided speech translations until 2012, which was extended with machine translations by Parllaw for speeches until 2019 \citep{rauh_documentation_2023}. We filled in the remaining translations using \emph{Gemini 2.5-flash} \citep{gemini_2025}. We tested its translations on a random sample of speeches that had been machine-translated by Parllaw and checked that Gemini (i) preserved speeches which were already in English and (ii) created translations with embeddings close to Parllaw's for non-English speeches (mean cosine similarity: $0.969$, $n=1001$; bootstrapped $0.95$ confidence interval). Thus, we assume that Gemini's and Parllaw's translations are similar enough to fill in the missing translations with Gemini's.
