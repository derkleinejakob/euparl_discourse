\subsubsection{Quantifying agenda setting}
% - control of agenda => political power (ref. to oxford paper?)
% - finding in germany: political right has influence over what other parties talk about. 
% seeing that parties infleunce the discourse, we ask ... 
Seing that parties strategically influence the debate \citep{saldivia_gonzatti_agenda_2026}, we investigate whether parties systematically emphasize migration in different contexts, and thereby ``put it on the agenda''. 
For this, we look at debates where all migration-related speeches stem from the same party bloc, indicating that migration is fed into the discussion by that group despite not being the main topic. We call such a debate an instance of agenda-setting and assign it a `true' topic: the topic with highest probability among its speeches.
