\subsubsection{Quantifying agenda setting}
% - control of agenda => political power (ref. to oxford paper?)
% - finding in germany: political right has influence over what other parties talk about. 
% seeing that parties infleunce the discourse, we ask ... 
Seing that parties influence and shape the debate \citep{saldivia_gonzatti_agenda_2026}, we investigate whether parties systematically emphasize migration in different contexts, effectively establishing a link between migration and other topics, and putting migration on the agenda. 
% A phenomenon studied in the literature is \emph{agenda setting}, which describes a political acteur's strive to place their topic of interest in the discourse [TODO: ref]. In the context of parliamentary debate in the EU, it is interesting to ask: do parties try to put migration on the agenda? 
For this purpose, we look at debates where all migration-related speeches stem from the same party block, indicating that migration is not the main topic of the debate but continuously mentioned by that party block. We define such a debate as an instance of agenda-setting by the respective party. To capture the actual topic of each debate, we assign it a 'true' topic, which is the topic with highest average probability among all speeches in that debate.
