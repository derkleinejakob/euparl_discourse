The continued success of right-wing populist parties in the 21st century is widely regarded as a major threat to European democracy and integration \citep{fossum_what_2023,rummens_populism_2017}. Populist rhetoric is commonly defined as constructing an antagonism between a `pure people' and a `corrupt elite' \citep{mudde_populist_2007}. Right-wing populism is also closely tied to the issue of immigration. Parties of this ideology have played a central role in the increasing politicisation of immigration \citep{hutter_politicising_2022}, which represents a crucial factor for their political success \citep{kende_xenophobia_2020}. Over the past decade, immigration has become an increasingly salient issue in European election campaigns \citep{dekeyser_elections_2023} as well as in media coverage \citep{greussing_shifting_2017}. [introduce agenda setting here?]

Electoral gains of populist parties have manifested in significant changes of parliamentary discourse \citep{schwalbach2023talking}. A recent quantitative analysis of EP speech embeddings has identified a gradual increase in emotional rhetoric from 1999 to 2022, with right-wing populist groups leading the trend \citep{subtil_verger_2024}. In the German national parliament, an LLM-based study has revealed increasing anti-solidarity messaging around immigration, not only for right-wing, but also christian-conservative and liberal parties \citep{kostikova_llm_2025}. This trend begins around 2015, which marks the onset of the so-called `refugee crisis' \citep{brueckner_crisis_2026}.

More fine-grained analyses of the migration discourse have revealed the use of common underlying narratives, defined as `selective depictions of reality' and `patterns of interpretation' through which the issue is relayed to the public. Social media posts from populist leaders commonly employ anti-immigrant frames like `immigrants take our jobs' or anti-establishment narratives such as `our sovereignty is under threat' \citep{seiger_navigating_2025}.

These previous successes in deconstructing and quantifying highly impactful political trends inspired the present investigation of how the growing prominence of right-wing populism and immigration as a salient political issue manifest in EP debates, with potential implications for broader societal discourse and legislative outcomes. All parliamentary speeches between 2014 and 2024 as recorded by the ParlLawSpeech dataset inform the analyses.

We employ unsupervised topic modeling to break down the prevalence of migration debates relative to other topics over the last decade, and provide evidence of agenda-setting strategies employed by right-wing populist groups (\Cref{sec:methods}). By embedding migration-labeled speeches into vector representations, we examine the semantic dimensions along which party groups can be differentiated and identify [wording too strong?] an increased use of previously identified anti-immigration narratives by right-wing groups [compared to moderate factions?] (\Cref{sec:results}).

% Building on these foundations, we apply computational methods to European Parliament debates to analyze migration discourse. We combine topic modeling to measure issue salience, semantic embeddings to map ideological positioning, and narrative detection to quantify the adoption of populist rhetorical frames across party groups.

% Speeches are first classified into topics using Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) to identify immigration-related debate and to estimate its prominence over time. Analyses of the distribution of migration-related speeches across predefined debate agendas provide quantitative evidence consistent with agenda-setting strategies employed by right-wing populist groups. With the use of speech embeddings, we examine the semantic dimensions along which party groups can be differentiated and find evidence for an increased use of previously identified anti-immigration narratives by right-wing groups compared to moderate factions.
