\subsection{Dimensions separating party blocs}\label{PLSresults}

PLS identifies directions in the embedding space that separate the party blocs meaningfully, with an averaged, cross-validated F1 score of $0.45 \pm 0.35$ (mean $ \pm$ std.\@ across validation folds). The most extreme examples of the corpus vocabulary, as embedded and reduced to two-dimensional space, are displayed in \Cref{fig:fig3_pls} and used for axis interpretation (see \Cref{sec:conclusion}).
