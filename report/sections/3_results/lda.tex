\subsection{Prevalence of migration speeches}

LDA organized all speeches into 30 interpretable and broadly coherent topics, with temporal trends in prevalence roughly consistent with salient world events, such as the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 or the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 (\Cref{fig:fig1_lda}). Although the proportion of migration-related speeches per year remained relatively stable, absolute counts peaked in 2015 and 2016, largely due to the use of written declarations (see \Cref{sec:methods}). [TODO: insert ratios per party here?]

\subsubsection{Setting the agenda}
All parties exhibit signs of agenda-setting behaviour. However, it is significantly more pronounced for far-right parties, with a yearly average of $15.9\%$ of their migration-related speech occuring in debates where they are the only party talking about migration --- compared to $6.6\%$ for other parties on average (ANOVA $p<0.001$). Far-right parties bring up migration mostly in debates where the 'true' topic is related to foreign relations (top 'true' topics: 'Trade Relations', 'EU Security / Defense', or 'Economic Development') while progressive parties (social democratic, green, left) link it most to humanitarian situations ('Disasters / Epidemics', 'International Conflicts', and 'Debate Etiquette / Brexit'), while for liberal and conservative there is was clear pattern ('EU Security / Defense', 'Debate Etiquette / Brexit', and 'Economic Development'). There is no evidence for a systematic change over the years.
