\subsection{Prevalence of migration speeches \& agenda setting}\label{LDAresults}

LDA organized the speeches into 30 interpretable and broadly coherent topics, with temporal trends in prevalence roughly consistent with salient world events, such as the outbreak of the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020 or the Russian invasion of Ukraine in 2022 (\Cref{fig:fig1_lda}). Although the proportion of migration-related speeches per year remains relatively stable, absolute counts peak in 2015 and 2016, largely due to the use of written declarations (see \Cref{sec:methods}). 

Migration-related speech rarely occurs in debates where only one party bloc addresses migration. Far right parties are a clear exception, with such instances acounting for $15.9\% \pm 7.7\%$ of their yearly mirgration-related speech, compared to $6.6\% \pm 0.6\%$ for others (ANOVA $p<.001$). They introduce migration mostly in debates where the `true' topic is ``Trade'', ``EU Security'', or ``Economic Development''.
