\subsubsection{Who talks about migration?}
Figure [TODO] shows the prevalence of migration as parliamentary topic, compared to selected reference topics. 
It shows a consistent prevalence of the issue since 2014 with minor fluctuations. 
% TODO what parties talk about migration? do some parties talk more?

\subsubsection{Setting the agenda}
% Agenda setting: 
% - control of agenda => political power (ref. to oxford paper?)
% - finding in germany: political right has influence over what other parties talk about. 
A phenomenon studied in the literature is \emph{agenda setting}, which describes a political acteur's strive to place their topic of interest in the discourse [TODO: ref]. In the context of parliamentary debate in the EU, it is interesting to ask: do parties try to put migration on the agenda? For this purpose, we looked at debates where all speeches that were labelled as migration-related stem from the same party block, indicating that migration is not the main topic of the debate, but continuously mentioned by that party block. We defined such a debate as an instance of agenda-setting by the respective party. All parties exhibit agenda-setting behaviour. However, it is drastically more pronounced for far-right parties, with X\% of their overall migration-related speech occuring debates where they are the only party talking about migration --- compared to Y\% for other parties on average [TODO: add significance statement]. Do parties systematically bring up migration in certain contexts? To answer this, we assigned each debate a 'true' topic, which is the topic with highest average probability among all speeches in that debate. Far-right parties bring up migration mostly in debates where the 'true' topic is related to foreign relations ('Trade Relations', 'EU Security / Defense', or 'Economic Development') while progressive parties (social democratic, green, left) link it most to humanitarian situations ('Disasters / Epidemics', 'International Conflicts', and 'Debate Etiquette / Brexit'), and for liberal and conservative there is no clear pattern ('EU Security / Defense', 'Debate Etiquette / Brexit', and 'Economic Development').
